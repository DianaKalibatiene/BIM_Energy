geographic location, life cycle environmental impacts, and Leadership in
Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). The researchers studied
worldwide variations in building energy use and associated life cycle
impacts in relation to the LEED rating systems. A Building Information
Modeling (BIM) of a reference 43 000 ft(2) office building was developed
and situated in 400 locations worldwide while making relevant changes to
the energy model to meet reference codes, such as ASHRAE 90.1. Then life
cycle environmental and human health impacts from the buildings' energy
consumption were calculated. The results revealed considerable
variations between sites in the U.S. and international locations
(ranging from 394 ton CO2 equiv to 911 ton CO2 equiv, respectively). The
variations indicate that location specific results, when paired with
life cycle assessment, can be an effective means to achieve a better
understanding of possible adverse environmental impacts as a result of
building energy consumption in the context of green building rating
systems. Looking at these factors in combination and using a systems
approach may allow rating systems like LEED to continue to drive market

abstract = {Contemporary advancements in Information Technology and the efforts from
various research initiatives in the AEC industry are showing evidence of
progress with the emergence of building information modelling (BIM). BIM
presents the opportunity of electronically modelling and managing the
vast amount of information embedded in a building project, from its
conception to end-of-life. Researchers have been looking at extensions
to expand its scope. Sustainability is one such modelling extension that
is in need of development. This is becoming pertinent for the structural
engineer as recent design criteria have put great emphasis on the
sustainability credentials in addition to the traditional criteria of
structural integrity, constructability and cost. With the complexity of
designs, there are now needs to provide decision support tools to aid in
the assessment of the sustainability credentials of design solutions.
Such tools would be most beneficial at the conceptual design stage so
that sustainability is built into the design solution starting from its
inception. The sustainability of buildings is related to life cycle and
is measured using indicator-terms such as life cycle costing, ecological
footprint and carbon footprint. This paper proposes a modelling
framework combining these three indicators in providing sustairiability
assessments of alternative design solutions based on the economic and
environmental sustainability pillars. It employs the principles of
feature-based modelling to extract construction-specific information
from product models for the purposes of sustainability analysis. A
prototype system is implemented using.NET and linked to the BIM enabled
software, Revit Structures (TM). The system appraises alternative design
solutions using multi-criteria performance analysis. This work
demonstrates that current process and data modelling techniques can be
employed to model sustainability related information to inform decisions
right from the early stages of structural design. It concludes that the
utilized information modelling representations - in the form of a
process model, implementation algorithms and object-based instantiations
- can capture sustainability related information to inform decisions at
the early stages of the structural design process. (C) 2014 Elsevier

teams find that green BIM can improve project outcomes, and facilitate
the accomplishment of established sustainability goals. Nevertheless,
green BIM remains an emerging trend to the majority of the industry, and
its full potential is yet to be explored according to recent market
research reports. The hypothesis of this research is that for companies
to succeed in practicing green BIM, a holistic approach that
strategically plans for BIM execution in green building projects is
needed. The BIM project execution planning guidelines (PEPG) is widely
adopted today to offer general guidance and standardized workflow of
strategic BIM implementation. PEPG is not meant to and lacks the
specificity to address green building projects in particular. However,
the popularity of PEPG is conceived as an opportunity for this research
to inherit its framework and create a special case of its implementation
in green building projects. Considering the prevalence of leadership in
energy and environmental design (LEED) green building rating system in
global green building industry, this research is further refined to
focus on LEED projects as an exemplary use case. Two major activities
conducted include: (1)a comprehensive literature review of existing
green BIM strategies and best practices; and (2)the proposition of an
integrated green BIM process map (IGBPM), which is essentially adapting
and further developing relevant process maps from PEPG and initiatives
such as the architecture, engineering, construction, owner and operator,

implementing BIM in LEED projects. The deliverables of this research
include level 1 IGBPM and examples of level 2 IGBPM process maps,

abstract = {With a view to legitimizing the adoption of Building Information
Modeling (BIM) in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC)
industry, researchers in recent years have endeavored to develop models
that can be used to analyze the costs/benefits of its implementation.
However, these models rely heavily on anecdotal evidence, guiding BIM
users to identify costs/benefits item by item. As a result, the
costs/benefits are too often underestimated or exaggerated. This paper
adopts an alternative approach, aiming to measure BIM costs/benefits by
demystifying the time-effort distribution curves of real-life AEC
processes. Empirical data on two public housing projects - one with BIM
implemented and the other without - are used to calculate the
costs/benefits of BIM implementation. It is found that, when compared
with the non-BIM project, BIM implementation increased the effort input
at the design stage by 45.93{\%} (which implies 100.9 FIRD/m(2) increase
in this study), but at the building stage decreased the cost per square
meter of GFA by 8.61{\%} (which indicates 591.76 HKD/m(2) saving in this
study). Taking a holistic view of the AEC processes, BIM implementation
contributed about a 6.92{\%} cost saving (which means 490.86 HKD/m(2)
saving in this study) to the sample BIM project. While these research
findings can be used to justify the promotion of more widespread BIM
adoption in the AEC industry, cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of BIM
implementation remains hampered by a general lack of data. (C) 2014

abstract = {Buildings in the 21st century are faced with the issues of extreme
climate and energy saving/carbon reduction. Currently all countries
realise that buildings are large consumers of energy during their life
cycle. The United Nations initiated `Global Green Policy'as well as
`Sustainable architecture and building initiative' that are related to
the use of resources in buildings. These policies strive for goals
`zero-resource buildings' and `building resource regulating'. Because of
this, many countries have developed various building resource codes in
dealing with building resource demand, thus gradually using
energy-saving materials and equipment and alternative renewable green
resources to coordinate with industry development. This includes actions
such as mandatory design standards, green procurement policies and
incentive subsidies and tax break policies. This research is directed
towards existing buildings in the Kaohsiung area (over 90{\%}). It uses
planning design analysis of existing building outer shell energy-saving
design transformation. By using data collection and choosing townhouses
in Kaohsiung city (representative case), we use a building energy
simulation in a building information model (BIM) to carry out efficiency
analysis and simulation of exterior energy-saving transformation. By
using simulation estimates for verification, the results integrate a
building environmental efficiency model (EEM) and evaluate its life
cycle cost and efficiency (LCCE). Research results can act as a
reference for sustainable building design transformation principles.},

synthesized using functionalized beta-Cyclodextrin (CD) with
1-benzylimidazole (BIM) to form monofunctionalized CD (beta CD-BIMOTs)
and was further polymerized using toluene diisocyanate (TDI) linker to
form insoluble beta CD-BIMOTs-TDI. SEM characterization result shows
that beta CD-BIMOTs-TDI exhibits macropore size while the BET result
shows low surface area (1.254 m(2) g(-1)). The unique properties of the
ILs allow us to produce materials with different morphologies. The
adsorption isotherm and kinetics of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) onto
beta CD-BIMOTs-TDI is studied. Freundlich isotherm and pseudo-second
order kinetics are found to be the best to represent the data for
2,4-DCP adsorption on the beta CD-BIMOTs-TDI. The presence of macropores
decreases the mass transfer resistance and increases the adsorption
process by reducing the diffusion distance. The change in entropy (Delta
S degrees) and heat of adsorption (Delta H degrees) for 2,4-DCP on
pCD-BIMOTs-TDI were estimated as -55.99 J/Kmol and -18.10 J/mol,
respectively. The negative value of Gibbs free energy (Delta G degrees)
indicates that the adsorption process is thermodynamically feasible,
spontaneous and chemically controlled. Finally, the interactions between
the cavity of beta CD-BIMOTs and 2,4-DCP are investigated and the
results shows that the inclusion of the complex formation and pi-pi
interaction are the main processes involved in the adsorption process.

reaching the proposed reduction in energy consumption and CO2 emissions

solution for works management and decision-making assessment, due to
their capacity to coordinate all the information needed for the
diagnosis of the building and the planning of the rehabilitation works.
If these models are generated from laser scanning point clouds
automatically textured with thermographic and RGB images, their
capacities are exponentially increased, since also their visualization
and not only the consultation of their data increases the information
available from the building. Since laser scanning, infrared thermography
and photography are techniques that acquire information of the object
as-is, the resulting BIM includes information on the real condition of
the building in the moment of inspection, consequently helping to a more
efficient planning of the rehabilitation works, enabling the repair of
the most severe faults. This paper proposes a methodology for the
automatic generation of textured as-built models, starting with data

abstract = {Decisions made during a building's early design stages critically
determine its environmental impact. However, designers are faced with
many decisions during these stages and typically lack intuition on which
decisions are most significant to a building's impact. As a result,
designers often defer decisions to later stages of the design process.
Life-cycle assessment (LCA) can be used to enable better early stage
decision-making by providing feedback on the environmental impacts of
building information modeling (BIM) design choices. This paper presents
a method for applying LCA to early stage decision-making in order to
inform designers of the relative environmental impact importance of
building component material and dimensioning choices. Sensitivity
analysis is used to generalize the method across a range of building
shapes and design parameters. An impact allocation scheme is developed
that shows the distribution of embodied impacts among building elements,
and an impact reduction scheme shows which material and thickness
decisions achieve the greatest embodied impact reductions. A
multi-building residential development is used as a case study for
introducing the proposed method to industry practice. Results show that
the method can assist in the building design process by highlighting
those early stage decisions that frequently achieve the most significant
reductions in embodied carbon footprint. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

abstract = {Nanoparticles are the materials having dimensions of the order of 100 nm
or less. They exhibit a high surface/volume ratio leading to different
properties far different from those of the bulk materials. The
development of uniform nanoparticles has been intensively pursued
because of their technological and fundamental scientific importance. A
number of chemical methods are available and are extensively used, but
these are often energy intensive and employ toxic chemicals. An
alternative approach for the synthesis of uniform nanoparticles is the
biological route that occurs at ambient temperature, pressure and at
neutral pH. The main aim of this review is to enlist and compare various
methods of synthesis of iron-based nanoparticles with emphasis on the
biological method. Biologically induced and controlled mineralization
mechanisms are the two modes through which the micro-organisms
synthesize iron oxide nanoparticles. In biologically induced
mineralization (BIM) mode, the environmental factors like pH, pO(2),
pCO(2), redox potential, temperature etc govern the synthesis of iron
oxide nanoparticles. In contrast, biologically controlled mineralization
(BCM) process initiates the micro-organism itself to control the
synthesis. BIM can be observed in the Fe(III) reducing bacterial species
of Shewanella, Geobacter, Thermoanaerobacter, and sulphate reducing
bacterial species of Archaeoglobus fulgidus, Desulfuromonas acetoxidans,
whereas BCM mode can be observed in the magnetotactic bacteria (MTB)
like Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum, M. gryphiswaldense and
sulphate-reducing magnetic bacteria (Desulfovibrio magneticus).
Magnetite crystals formed by Fe(III)-reducing bacteria are epicellular,
poorly crystalline, irregular in shapes, having a size range of 10-50 nm
super-paramagnetic particles, with a saturation magnetization value
ranging from 75-77 emu/g and are not aligned in chains. Magnetite
crystals produced by MTB have uniform species-specific morphologies and
sizes, which are mostly unknown from inorganic systems. The unusual
characteristics of magnetosome particles have attracted a great
interdisciplinary interest and inspired numerous ideas for their
biotechnological applications. The nanoparticles synthesized through
biological method are uniform with size ranging from 5 to 100 nm, which
can potentially be used for various applications.},

assess the environmental impact of vehicles, using different approaches,
and evaluating their benefits and limitations. Rating systems are
analysed as tools to compare the environmental impact of vehicles,
allowing decision makers to dedicate their financial and non-financial
policies and support measures in function of the ecological damage. The
paper is based on the ``Clean Vehicles{\{}''{\}} research project,
commissioned by the Brussels Capital Region via the BIM-IBGE (Brussels
Institute for the Conservation of the Environment) (Van Mierlo et al.,
2001). The Vrije Universiteit Brussel (ETEC) and the Universite Libre de
Bruxelles (CEESE) have jointly carried out the workprogramme. The most
important results of this project are illustrated in this paper. First
an overview of environmental, economical and technical characteristics
of the different alternative fuels and drive trains is given. Afterward
the basic principles to identify the environmental impact of cars are
described. An outline of the considered emissions and their
environmental impact leads to the definition of the calculation method,
named Ecoscore. A rather simple and pragmatic approach would be stating
that all alternative fuelled vehicles (LPG, CNG, EV, HEV, etc.) can be
considered as `clean'. Another basic approach is considering as `clean'
all vehicles satisfying a stringent emission regulation like EURO IV or
EEV. Such approaches however don't tell anything about the real
environmental damage of the vehicles. In the paper we describe ``how
should the environmental impact of vehicles be defined?{\{}''{\}}, including
parameters affecting the emissions of vehicles and their influence on
human beings and on the environment and ``how could it be defined ?{\{}''{\}},
taking into account the availability of accurate and reliable data. We
take into account different damages (acid rain, photochemical air
pollution, global warming, noise, etc.) and their impacts on several
receptors like human beings (e.g.: cancer, respiratory diseases, etc);
ecosystems, or buildings. The presented methodology is based on a kind
of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in which the contribution of all
emissions to a certain damage are considered (e.g. using
Exposure-Response damage function). The emissions will include oil
extraction, transportation refinery, electricity production,
distribution, (Well-to-Wheel approach), as well as the emission due to
the production, use and dismantling of the vehicle (Cradle-to-Grave
approach). The different damages will be normalized to be able to make a
comparison. Hence a reference value (determined by the reference vehicle
chosen) will be defined as a target value (the normalized value will
thus measure a kind of Distance to Target). The contribution of the
different normalized damages to a single value ``EcoScore{\{}''{\}} will be
based on a panel weighting method. Some examples of the calculation of
the Ecoscore for different alternative fuels and drive trains will be
calculated as an illustration of the methodology.},

investigated the ability of the N-imidazole derivative,
1-benzylimidazole (BIM), to induce CYP1A in rainbow trout hepatocytes.
Benzylimidazole increased hepatocellular CYP1A catalytic activity
(determined as 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase {\{}[{\}}EROD] activity) and
CYP1A mRNA in a concentration-dependent way. Computational studies on
the molecular structure of BIM indicated that the energetically most
stable BIM conformer has the imidazole ring and the phenyl ring in
different planes, i.e., does not take a planar conformation. This
property of BIM does not agree with the structural requirements of a
typical AhR ligand. In line with this observation, we found that the AhR
antagonist, alpha-naphthoflavone (alphaNF), was not able to inhibit BIM
induction of EROD activity and CYP1A mRNA, although it inhibited the
induction of CYP1A by the prototypic AhR ligand, alpha-naphthoflavone
(betaNF). The results suggest that transcriptional activation of CYP1A

abstract = {The paper reviews and discusses various policies which have hampered the
sustainable growth of RETs in the mountain communities of the Hindu Kush
Himalayan (HKH) Region in one hand, hut on the other RETs interventions
have not only significantly improved the energy situation at household
level but also helped to support the economic productivity of the
mountain area. This paper identifies that compatibility of technology
design to suit the local conditions, private sector participation in the
development of RETs and affordability of mountain communities for
acquiring RET devices are critical for enhancing financial viability of
RETs.
The identification of various issues have been instrumental in order to
recognize the need for programme coordination adopting holistic approach
with long-term vision for technology promotion; need for adoption of
integrated approach for the development of RETs; need for increasing
opportunity for women's to participate in the programme; need for strong
research, development and demonstration, need for skill upgradation
through training, need for technical backup and monitoring service; need
for capacity building at local level for repair, maintenance and
production of small-scale renewable energy technologies; need for
awareness generation not only among users but also among planners,
developers and promoters; need for strong quality control and
standardization; need for warranty and insurance to safeguard the
entrepreneurs and users from losses and the need for the consideration
of social equity for poor and marginalized mountain population.
The study proposes framework for policy recommendations to promote the
development of renewable energy resources and technologies to provide
broad policy guidelines not only for Nepal but also in the context of
HKH Region, which has six components: a) Recognize and measure the
benefits of renewable energy technologies (RETs) with particular
emphasis on drudgery reduction; b) Reform energy-price signals so as to
provide leveled play-field for each energy source; c) Revamp the energy
decision making process so as to promote decentralized renewable energy
technologies and involvement of local level institutions; d) Change
energy users' investment incentives by attracting the private sector and
NGOs participation in manufacturing and promoting RETs; e) Accelerate
investments in commercialization of RETs by supporting RD {\&} D, capacity
building, information and awareness generation through public sector or
donor funding and by providing attractive incentives to manufacturers;
and f) Develop commercialization plan for each RET to suit location
specific needs. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

comparing the patterns extracted from the BIM model to the standard

parameters of energy consumption using BIM technology which can evaluate
the buildings energy performance. First, three forms of general states

Autodesk Revit Software. Then, the main building form for energy
modeling and analysis was selected. Autodesk Revit 2020 software was
also used to obtain the results of climate data analysis and building

examining different energy consumption modes. The results showed that
the use of building information modeling technology in adjusting the
parameters affecting energy consumption can save energy cost up to
58.23{\%} in block D. Energy cost savings for block C and the western
lobby were obtained as 51.03{\%} and 43.05{\%}, respectively. Based on
energy use intensity, energy cost savings for blocks C, D, and the
western lobby were estimated as 16.67{\%}, 16.30{\%}, and 11{\%},
respectively. The results of parametric studies on alternative schemes
of energy use intensity optimization showed that 16.30{\%} savings could
be achieved by the base building model in a 30-year time horizon.

review of research on Sustainability of Heritage Buildings (SHBs).
Design/methodology/approach This review highlights methodologies applied
in SHBs research and analyzes major global rating systems in order to
identify their deficiencies for SHBs assessment. A systematic review was
employed and articles from the top 10 high impact factor journals were
studied. Twelve major global rating systems and their assessment
criteria were identified. Findings Significant variability was observed
among the assessment tools since each tool assesses several criteria,
factors and indicators that fit its local context. Part of this
variability can also be seen in the rating scales, threshold values and
accreditation titles. As a result, the final sustainability ranking for
a given building cannot be compared among the 12 rating systems. Most
importantly, these systems fail to analyze some factors such as energy
that are considered important with respect to heritage building
assessment. Originality/value Since no specific rating system could be
identified in this review as the most appropriate for heritage
buildings, a new sustainability assessment tool that is specific to
heritage buildings should be developed. Such a tool will enable facility
managers to evaluate and improve the sustainability of their heritage
buildings while preserving them.},

abstract = {Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been widely adopted to identify the
Global Warming Potential (GWP) in the construction industry and
determine its high environmental impact through Greenhouse Gas (GHG)
emissions, energy and resource consumptions. The consideration of LCA in
the early stages of design is becoming increasingly important as a means
to avoid costly changes at later stages of the project. However, typical
LCA-based tools demand very detailed information about structural and
material systems and thus become too laborious for designers in the
conceptual stages, where such specifications are still loosely defined.
In response, this paper presents a workflow for LCA-based evaluation
where the selection of the construction system and material is kept open
to compare the impacts of alternative design variants. We achieve this
through a strict division into support and infill systems and a
simplified visualization of a schematic floor layout using a shoebox
approach, inspired from the energy modelling domain. The shoeboxes in
our case are repeatable modules within a schematic floor plan layout,
whose enclosures are defined by parametric 2D surfaces representing
total ratios of permanent supports versus infill components. Thus, the
assembly of modular surface enclosures simplifies the LCA evaluation
process by avoiding the need to accurately specify the physical
properties of each building component across the floor plan. The
presented workflow facilitates the selection of alternative structural
systems and materials for their comparison, and outputs the Global
Warming Potential (GWP) in the form of an intuitive visualization
output. The workflow for simplified evaluation is illustrated through a
case study that compares the GWP for selected combinations of material
choice and construction systems.},

prefabricated residential buildings (PRBs) during the materialization
phase based on building information modeling (BIM) and a carbon emission
measurement model. The model is constructed using the carbon emission
coefficient method. For more accurate measurement, the materialization
phase of PRBs' carbon cycle is re-defined into five stages (material
production, material transportation, component production, component
transportation, and construction). This innovative system also
incorporates Microsoft Access-based databases for data management. The
implementation of the system in a PRB project in Shenzhen, China
revealed that over 90{\%} of carbon emissions were generated in the
building material production and construction stages, and overall carbon
emissions per unit volume of all the prefabricated components were
764.87 kg/m(3), 20.11{\%} lower than those of the cast-in-situ parts.
Compared with results obtained from the traditional method, the system's
percentage error was 6.52{\%}, showing good reliability in carbon emission
measurement. The discrepancy was reasonably justified by inevitable
material losses and transportation distances. It is concluded that the
measurement system can accurately predict PRB projects' carbon emissions
in project planning and early design, identify key areas for carbon
emission pre-control, and facilitate dynamic management of carbon
emission reduction during the materialization phase. (C) 2020 Elsevier

abstract = {The iterative and developing nature of designing a building involves the
specification and handling of vague, imprecise, and incomplete
information. A crucial factor for mitigating the impact of these
uncertainties on the decision-making process is to effectively quantify
and communicate them among the project stakeholders. The interactive
visualization of 3D building models provides great support for
evaluating building designs. However, the currently available
visualization methods of the available authoring tools do not
incorporate the potential uncertainties associated with the geometric
and semantic information of building elements. Currently, building
models appear precise and certain, even in the early design stages,
which can lead to false assumptions and model evaluations, affecting the
decisions made throughout the design stages. Hence, this paper presents
a set of visualization approaches, including intrinsic, extrinsic,
animation, and walkthroughs, that have been developed to present the
uncertainties associated with the building elements' information. The
efficiency of the approaches developed in this study was evaluated
through an online survey and interviews. More specifically, the
approaches were compared in terms of intuitiveness, applicability, and
acceptance. The evaluation results positively indicated the
participants' ability to understand the amount and impact of the
uncertainties on the design by using the developed approaches.},

abstract = {Two new methods to generate structural system layouts for conceptual
building spatial designs are presented. The first method, the design
response grammar, uses design rules-configurable by parameters-to
develop a structural system layout step by step as a function of a
building spatial design's geometry and preliminary assessments of the
structural system under development. The second method, design via
optimizer assignment, uses an evolutionary algorithm to assign
structural components to a building spatial design's geometry. In this
work, the methods are demonstrated for two objectives: minimal strain
energy (a commonly used objective for structural topology optimization)
and minimal structural volume. In a first case study three building
spatial designs have been subjected to the methods: Design via optimizer
assignment yields a uniformly distributed Pareto front approximation,
which incorporates the best performing layouts among both methods. On
the other hand, results of the design response grammar show that layouts
that correspond to specific positions on the Pareto front (e.g. layouts
that perform well for strain energy), share the same parameter
configurations among the three different building spatial designs. By
generalizing, specific points on the Pareto front approximation have
been expressed in terms of parameter configurations. A second case study
addresses the use of a generic material and generic dimensions in the
assessment of structural system layouts. The study applies a technique
similar to topology optimization to optimize the material density
distribution of each individual structural component, which can be
regarded as a part of determining materials and dimensions in more
advanced stages of the design of a system layout. This optimization
approach is applied to the layouts that are part of the Pareto front
approximations as found by the evolutionary algorithm in the first case
study, the study shows that-after optimization-the fronts remain the
same qualitatively, suggesting that the methods produce results that are
also useful in more advanced design stages. A final case study tests the
generalization that is established in the first case study by using the
found configurations for the design response grammar, and it is shown
that the generated layouts indeed are positioned near the desired
positions on the Pareto front approximation found by the evolutionary
algorithm. Although the evolutionary algorithm can find better
performing solutions among a better distributed Pareto front
approximation, the design response grammar uses only a fraction of the
computational cost. As such it is concluded that the design response
grammar is a promising support tool for the exploration and structural
assessment of conceptual building spatial designs. Future research
should focus on more types of structural elements; more objectives; new
constraints to ensure feasible solutions, especially stress constraints;
and the application of state-of-the-art techniques like machine learning
to find more generalizations.},

abstract = {Purpose Visual inspection and human judgement form the cornerstone of
daily operations and maintenance (O{\&}M) services activities carried out
by facility managers nowadays. Recent advances in technologies such as
building information modelling (BIM), distributed sensor networks,
augmented reality (AR) technologies and digital twins present an immense
opportunity to radically improve the way daily O{\&}M is conducted. This
paper aims to describe the development of an AR-supported automated
environmental anomaly detection and fault isolation method to assist
facility managers in addressing problems that affect building occupants'
thermal comfort. Design/methodology/approach The developed system
focusses on the detection of environmental anomalies related to the
thermal comfort of occupants within a building. The performance of three
anomaly detection algorithms in terms of their ability to detect indoor
temperature anomalies is compared. Based on the fault tree analysis
(FTA), a decision-making tree is developed to assist facility management
(FM) professionals in identifying corresponding failed assets according
to the detected anomalous symptoms. The AR system facilitates easy
maintenance by highlighting the failed assets hidden behind
walls/ceilings on site to the maintenance personnel. The system can thus
provide enhanced support to facility managers in their daily O{\&}M
activities such as inspection, recording, communication and
verification. Findings Taking the indoor temperature inspection as an
example, the case study demonstrates that the O{\&}M management process
can be improved using the proposed AR-enhanced inspection system.
Comparative analysis of different anomaly detection algorithms reveals
that the binary segmentation-based change point detection is effective
and efficient in identifying temperature anomalies. The decision-making
tree supported by FTA helps formalise the linkage between temperature
issues and the corresponding failed assets. Finally, the AR-based model
enhanced the maintenance process by visualising and highlighting the
hidden failed assets to the maintenance personnel on site.
Originality/value The originality lies in bringing together the advances
in augmented reality, digital twins and data-driven decision-making to
support the daily O{\&}M management activities. In particular, the paper
presents a novel binary segmentation-based change point detection for
identifying temperature anomalous symptoms, a decision-making tree for
matching the symptoms to the failed assets, and an AR system for
visualising those assets with related information.},

the ability to obtain the energy model of the building using the BIM

simulating the real energy behavior of the building and the improvement
in the building's lighting systems, both natural and artificial, in
particular daylighting. In this way, the BIM 6D simulation allows us to
make design and operation decisions for the building, not only for new
buildings that must be, in accordance with current legislation, NZEB

existing buildings. Particularly in buildings for sanitary use, BIM 6D
allows an exhaustive analysis of the energy impact of said
rehabilitation, guiding it towards an improvement in energy and light
efficiency, which in turn provides greater quality and comfort in the
use of the sustainable building. This subject of study is especially
important in public buildings for hospital use. Buildings where energy
efficiency and comfort, oriented towards optimal and efficient lighting,
are two fundamental criteria highly appreciated by patients and citizens
in general. Once the energy model of the building has been obtained, it
is possible to study and identify possible alternatives to improve
energy efficiency and improve lighting, as well as to analyze the
possibilities of incorporating other more efficient forms of renewable
energy, such as the use of daylight. In this work we can see how
applying a set of simulated improvement actions in BIM 6D achieves an
energy saving of 50{\%} in general and up to 13{\%} only by acting on
lighting systems, allowing the decarbonization of buildings with high
energy consumption, such as hospitals, and in turn, will lead to an
improvement in the energy certification of these buildings; thus
achieving a better and higher quality of habitability, using more

design technology in response to climatic change and global warming
issues will continue. However, the need to preserve and sustain the
natural environment is also crucial. A building envelope plays a pivotal
role in areas where the greatest heat and energy loss often occur.
Investment for the passive design aspect of building envelopes is
essential to address CO2 emission. This research aims to explore the
suitability of using integral-monolithic structural insulation
fibre-reinforced lightweight aggregate concrete (LWAC) without
additional insulation as a building envelope material in a high-rise
residential building in the different climatic zones of the world.
Polypropylene and steel fibres in different dosages were used in a
structural grade expanded clay lightweight aggregate concrete. Physical
and thermal properties of fibre reinforced structural LWAC, normal
weight concrete (NWC) and bricks were measured in the lab. The
Autodesk@Revit-GBS simulation program was implemented to simulate the
energy consumption of a 29-storey residential building with shear wall
structural system using the proposed fibre-reinforced LWAC materials.
Results showed that energy savings between 3.2{\%} and 14.8{\%} were
incurred in buildings using the fibre-reinforced LWAC across various
climatic regions as compared with traditional NWC and sand-cement brick
and clay brick walls. In conclusion, fibre-reinforced LWAC in hot-humid
tropical and temperate Mediterranean climates meet the certified Green
Building Index (GBI) requirements of less than 150 kW.h.m(-2). However,
in extreme climatic conditions of sub-arctic and hot semi-arid desert
climates, a thicker wall or additional insulation is required to meet
the certified green building requirements. Hence, the energy-saving
measure is influenced largely by the use of fibre-reinforced LWAC as a
building envelope material rather than because of building orientation.},

the design, when most decisions on specifications of building systems
are made. There has been a growing attempt in the literature to enable
such simulations at earlier phases of design, when decisions' impact on
the lifecycle behavior is the strongest. While researchers have
developed tools/models to support planning and conceptualization phases
from this aspect; there have been not much developments for early design
development stage (which is usually the scope of semi-detailed cost
estimates). This paper introduces a software tool for generating
multiple design scenarios and evaluating them, by combining energy
simulation and economic analyses, at schematic design and early design
development phases of building projects. In this regard, we used
state-of-the art of open source technologies, as well as cloud
computing, to integrate energy simulation into the alternative selection
procedure. The developed system focuses on architectural parameters;
lighting power density; and heating, ventilation and air conditioning
(HVAC). Analysis of sensitivity of lifecycle energy to such parameters,
in a group of representative real-world projects, helped us to limit
variations of such parameters, and subsequently their combinations.
Using Open-Studio measures and the computational power offered by the
cloud, our system generates/simulates all possible design scenarios

compares them based on building economics performance measures. The

gathers all the information of a project in a single virtual prototype,
which can then be studied throughout its life cycle. One of the main
difficulties in its use is the limited training of professionals in its
use and scope. Consequently, this research proposes a real-time work
procedure where, by using the BIM methodology in the initial stages of
the design process, this constitutes a support system for
decision-making with respect to Building Sustainability. With this in
mind, basic guidelines are set out to develop a pilot classroom
experience that integrates the use of the BIM methodology, by making a
Building Energy Model (BEM) of three commonly used social housing
prototypes in San Juan, Argentina. The result is the BIM Execution Plan

evaluated in terms of both energy consumption and thermal comfort, and
their scores were published online in real-time. A total of 339

abstract = {The building sector has a significant potential to reduce the material
resource demand needed for construction and therefore, greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions. Digitalization can help to make use of this potential
and improve sustainability throughout the entire building's life cycle.
One way to address this potential is through the integration of Life
Cycle Assessment (LCA) into the building process by employing Building
Information Modeling (BIM). BIM can reduce the effort needed to carry
out an LCA, and therefore, facilitate the integration into the building
process. A review of current industry practice and scientific literature
shows that companies are lacking the incentive to apply LCA. If applied,
there are two main approaches. Either the LCA is performed in a
simplified way at the beginning of the building process using imprecise
techniques, or it is done at the very end when all the needed
information is available, but it is too late for decision-making. One
reason for this is the lack of methods, workflows and tools to implement
BIM-LCA integration over the whole building development. Therefore, the
main objective of this study is to develop an integrated BIM-LCA method
for the entire building process by relating it to an established
workflow. To avoid an additional effort for practitioners, an existing
structure for cost estimation in the Swiss context is used. The
established method is implemented in a tool and used in a case study in
Switzerland to test the approach. The results of this study show that
LCA can be performed continuously in each building phase over the entire
building process using existing Building Information Modeling (BIM)
techniques for cost estimation. The main benefit of this approach is
that it simplifies the application of LCA in the building process and
therefore gives incentives for companies to apply it. Moreover, the
re-work caused by the need for re-entering data and the usage of many
different software tools that characterize most of the current LCA
practices is minimized. Furthermore, decision-making, both at the
element and building levels, is supported.},

abstract = {The increasing global importance of climate change has been clearly
recognised in the last few years. The building industry contributed to a
large proportion of the global energy use and carbon emissions across
material production, construction, operation and end-of-life. Utilizing
computer simulation and optimisation to minimize the building life cycle
environmental impacts has gained increasing attentions recently. There
were researches on different kinds of computational optimisation in
various contexts, but a critical review to identify and compare the
optimisation approaches is still lacking and needed to demonstrate their
strengths/weaknesses and to highlight the future research challenges.
Therefore, the objective of this paper was to critically review the
computer simulation and optimisation studies for minimizing the life
cycle energy consumption and carbon emissions in buildings, with the aim
of identifying the current practices and future research need in this
field. The common research streams and methods (e.g., innovative
structural systems and materials, energy retrofitting measures) were
compared, with an in-depth analysis on the importance and benefits that
come with their usages. Life cycle design optimisation with the
consideration of production, operation and end-of-life of building
systems has a growing importance for the sustainable development of the
future towards resource-based circular economy. Moreover, emerging
digital technologies (such as machine learning, data-driven design, and
parametric 3D modelling) enable greater automation in early design
exploration and advance decision marking in design optimisation. As
human factors (e.g., energy-related occupant behaviours) become
important metrics in the built environment, multi-disciplinary design
should be adopted to generate social-technical solutions that encompass
both environmental sustainability and human wellbeing. (C) 2020 Elsevier

this process and its regulation has been a subject of study in the last
three decades. Members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins are involved in
the regulation of apoptosis through mitochondrial poration with the
subsequent initiation of apoptosis. Deregulation of proapoptotic
proteins contributes to the progression of many tumor processes.
Understanding how these pore-forming Bcl-2 proteins Bak and Bax are
activated is key to find new anticancer treatments. As no drug capable
of activating Bak has been disclosed yet, the study of the structural
features of BH3 peptides-known as Bak activators-relevant for binding
along with its binding energy decomposition analysis, becomes essential
for designing novel small-molecule mimics of BH3. Interestingly, a BH3
Bim analogue-inactivating Bak has recently been discovered, opening a
question on the molecular features that determine the functions of BH3
peptides. Therefore, the present work is aimed at understanding the way
BH3 peptides activate or inactivate Bak in order to identify
differential structural features that can be used in drug design. For
this purpose, complexes of Bak with an activator and an inhibitor have
been subjected to a molecular dynamics study. Structural differences
were assessed by means of the fluctuations of the corresponding
principal components. Moreover, the MMPB/GBSA approach was used to
compute the binding free energy of the diverse complexes to identify
those residues of the BH3 peptide that exhibit the larger contributions
to complex formation. The results obtained in this work show differences
between activators and inhibitors, both in structural and energetic
terms, which can be used in the design of new molecules that can
activate or inactivate proapoptotic Bak.},

system (BMS) in modern buildings, there is an opportunity of using the
data to extend the use of building energy modeling (BEM) beyond the

measurement and verification, and operations and controls. However,
while BMS is collecting a vast amount of operation data, different
suppliers and sensor installers typically apply their own customized or
even random non-uniform rules to define the metadata, i.e., the point
tags. This results in a need to interpret and manually map any BMS data
before using it for energy analysis. The mapping process is
labor-intensive, error-prone, and requires comprehensive prior
knowledge. Additionally, BMS metadata typically has considerable variety
and limited context information, limiting the applicability of existing
interpreting methods. In this paper, we proposed a text mining framework
to facilitate interpreting and mapping BMS points to EnergyPlus
variables. The framework is based on unsupervised density-based
clustering (DBSCAN) and a novel fuzzy string matching algorithm
``X-gram{\{}''{\}}. Therefore, it is generalizable among different buildings
and naming conventions. We compare the proposed framework against
commonly used baselines that include morphological analysis and widely

Transition (LCT). The literature recognises the need to move towards a
transdisciplinary approach in ER, which encompasses multidisciplinarity

disciplines remains a significant problem, mainly due to challenges
associated with knowledge exchange across the allied disciplines that
play a role in ER. The authors posit that ER projects has been

integrated approach that is akin to transdisciplinarity could become
commonplace. Against this background, the aim of this paper is to
establish to what extent ER has been conceptualised as a System in the
literature so that complexities can effectively be managed through a
transdisciplinary approach. This work is based on a literature review of
136 peer-reviewed journal papers. The content analysis demonstrates that
current research on transdisciplinarity in ER can be conceptualised in
five categories and 15 lines of research. They are presented as a
Conceptual Framework, which is this paper's main contribution to
existing knowledge. It reveals the direction of innovation in ER for
LCT, and is illustrated as a cognitive map. This map exposes the current
fragmentation implicit in the literature, and proposes critical
connections that need to be established for a transdisciplinary
approach. It also shows that the discourse on LCT changed by moving
beyond the building scale; and recognising the need to embrace
disruptive and local technologies, and integrating the social and
technical aspects of ER. Innovative technical solutions and robust
information modelling approaches emerge as key vehicles towards making
decisions that pay regard to the economic, social and technical factors
and that empower the prosumers to play an active role in LCT. Crown

economic expansion and growing numbers of railway and road
infrastructures. Owing to the complexity of bridge design, traditional
design methods always create tedious and time-consuming construction
processes. In recent years, Building Information Modelling (BIM) has
been developed rapidly to provide a faster solution to generate and
process the integration of information in a shared environment. This
paper aims to highlight an innovative 6D BIM approach for the lifecycle
asset management of a bridge infrastructure by using Donggou Bridge as a
case study. This paper adopts 6D modelling, incorporating 3D model
information with time schedule, cost estimation, and carbon footprint
analysis across the lifecycle of the bridge project. The results of this
paper reveal that raw materials contribute the most embodied carbon
emissions, and as the 6D BIM model was developed in the early stage of
the lifecycle, stakeholders can collaborate within the BIM environment
to enhance a more sustainable and cost-effective outcome in advance.
This study also demonstrates the possibility of BIM applications to
bridge infrastructure projects throughout the whole lifecycle. The 6D
BIM can save time by transforming 2D information to 3D information and
reducing errors during the pre-construction and construction stages
through better visualisation for staff training. Moreover, 6D BIM can
promote efficient asset and project management since it can be applied
for various purposes simultaneously, such as sustainability, lifecycle
asset management and maintenance, condition monitoring and real-time
structural simulations. In addition, BIM can promote cooperation among
working parties and improve visualisation of the project for various
stakeholders.},

abstract = {The building envelope, the most important element in the energy
consumption of a building, gains more importance due to the large amount
of the surface area of building's facade in high-rise buildings. The
energy consumption of these buildings is increasing depending on their
high transparency ratio as a result of decrease in the thermal
resistance of the facade. The aim of this study is to show the
importance of building envelope design in energy efficiency of high-rise
residential buildings and to analyze the effect of the building envelope
design on energy consumption. Turkey's highest residential building from
2010 to 2017 was selected for the case building. DesignBuilder program
with the EnergyPlus simulation engine was used for energy analysis of
the building. The energy consumption results were compared with the
other study data in the literature. As a consequence of the simulation
conducted according to the existing facade of the building, 25{\%} of the
energy is used for heating and 14{\%} for cooling in total energy
consumption. It has been found that the building envelope designed with
double-layered air corridor can offer the maximum level of residential
comfort to the occupants. This study shows that the building facade with
air corridor also reduces energy consumption by 30{\%} compared to the
same sized buildings.},

abstract = {Rework during construction is often required due to errors and omissions
contained in the engineering documentation that is produced. If errors
and omissions go undetected, they may become embedded within the
`asbuilt' documents that are provided to an asset owner at practical
completion. In the specific case of instrumentation and control systems
(ICSs), errors and omissions are often found in as-builts. This
adversely impacts productivity and safety during the operations and
maintenance process, as information is not readily available. In the
case of liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants, for example, shutdown
periods may have to be extended, which can jeopardise the production and
supply of gas and therefore place a strain on energy markets. The
research presented in this paper aims to address this issue by proposing
a novel digital system information model which can be used to improve
the robustness of an LNG operator's asset information management system.
The creation of a digital model provides a platform for future-proofing
LNG assets and minimising the duration of shutdown periods. The research
provides the LNG sector with an innovative solution for digitising their
ICSs so that assets can efficiently and effectively be maintained and

This article presents the results of the multidisciplinary research
project SCI{\_}BIM, which is conducted on an occupied existing building.
Within SCI{\_}BIM, a workflow for coupling digital technologies for
scanning and modeling of buildings is developed. Laser scanning is used
for capturing the geometry, and ground-penetrating radar is used for
assessing material composition. For the semi-automated generation of an
as-built BIM, algorithms are developed, wherefore the Point-Cloud serves
as a basis. The BIM-model is used for energy modeling and analysis as
well as for the automated compilation of Material Passports. Further, a
gamification concept will be developed to motivate the buildings' users
to collect data. By applying the gamification concept, the reduction of
energy consumption together with an automated update of the as-built BIM
will be tested. This article aims to analyze the complex
interdisciplinary interactions, data, and model exchange processes of
various disciplines collaborating within SCI{\_}BIM.
Results show that the developed methodology is confronted with many
challenges. Nevertheless, it has the potential to serve as a basis for

reinforced concrete engineering contributes to the largest proportion of

of available data or digital measurements. Additionally, solutions based
on Building Information Modelling (BIM) also require high quality and
precise geometrically-based models, which are not typically available
for existing buildings. As such, this work introduces a semi-automated
BEPS input solution for existing building exteriors that can be
integrated with other related technologies (such as BIM or CityGML) and
deployed across an entire building stock. Within the overarching
approach, a novel sub-process automatically transforms a point cloud
obtained from a terrestrial laser scanner into a representation of a
building's exterior facade geometry as input data for a BEPS engine.
Semantic enrichment is performed manually. This novel solution extends
two existing approaches: (1) an angle criterion in boundary detection
and (2) a voxelisation representation to improve performance. The use of
laser scanning data reduces temporal costs and improves input accuracy
for BEPS model generation of existing buildings. The approach is tested
herein on two example cases. Vertical and horizontal accuracies of 1{\%}
and 7{\%} were generated, respectively, when compared against
independently produced, measured drawings. The approach showed variation
in accuracy of model generation, particularly for upper floors of the
test case buildings. However, the energy impacts resulting from these
variations represented less than 1{\%} of the energy consumption for both
cases.},

abstract = {Design optimization of reinforced concrete structures helps reducing the
global carbon emissions and the construction cost in buildings. Previous
studies mainly targeted at the optimization of individual structural
elements in low-rise buildings. High-rise reinforced concrete buildings
have complicated structural designs and consume tremendous amounts of
resources, but the corresponding optimization techniques were not fully
explored in literature. Furthermore, the relationship between the
optimization of individual structural elements and the topological
arrangement of the entire structure is highly interactive, which calls
for new optimization methods. Therefore, this study aims to develop a
novel optimization approach for cost-optimal and low-carbon design of
high-rise reinforced concrete structures, considering both the
structural topology and individual element optimizations. Parametric
modelling is applied to define the relationship between individual
structural members and the behavior of the entire building structure. A
novel evolutionary optimization technique using the genetic algorithm is
proposed to optimize concrete building structures, by first establishing
the optimal structural topology and then optimizing individual member
sizes. In an illustrative example, a high-rise reinforced concrete
building is used to examine the proposed optimization approach, which
can systematically explore alternative structural designs and identify
the optimal solution. It is shown that the carbon emissions and material
cost are both reduced by 18-24{\%} after performing optimization. The
proposed approach can be extended to optimize other types of buildings
(such as steel framework) with a similar problem nature, thereby
improving the cost efficiency and environmental sustainability of the
built environment.},

applications such as building information modelling (BIM), spatial
location application, energy consumption estimation, and signal

clouds has already attracted considerable research interest. However, in
the complex indoor environment, automated reconstruction of detailed 3D
models still remains a serious challenge. To address these issues, this
paper presents a novel method that couples linear structures with
three-dimensional geometric surfaces to automatically reconstruct 3D
models using point cloud data from mobile laser scanning. In our
proposed approach, a fully automatic room segmentation is performed on
the unstructured point clouds via multi-label graph cuts with semantic
constraints, which can overcome the over-segmentation in the long
corridor. Then, the horizontal slices of point clouds with individual
room are projected onto the plane to form a binary image, which is
followed by line extraction and regularization to generate floorplan
lines. The 3D structured models are reconstructed by multi-label graph
cuts, which is designed to combine segmented room, line and surface
elements as semantic constraints. Finally, this paper proposed a novel
application that 5G signal simulation based on the output structural
model to aim at determining the optimal location of 5G small base

industrial applications because of its potential to bring about
high-level of industrialization, environmental benefits, and

focus of many recent studies. While these studies have greatly advanced
precast supply chain management (PSCM), a critical analysis to summarize
the recent research, to identify research gaps, and to inform future
research needs is largely missing in the field of precast supply chain
management. The overarching goal of this paper is to create a taxonomy
to properly classify existing studies in precast supply chain management
so as to reveal research gaps and suggest future research opportunities.
The specific tasks in this review project include: (1) conducting
bibliographic categorizations with regard to journals, years and
geographic distributions of publications; (2) identifying the citation
correlations and formulating the keyword connection networks; (3)
classifying the literature based on research topics and highlighting the
state of the art pertaining to each subtopic. The in-depth analysis
shows that the studies on precast production are dominant in the PSCM
domain. The major research approaches used in existing studies include
the genetic algorithm, simulation, RFID (Radio Frequency

possible future research focuses are highlighted, such as dynamic

abstract = {Purpose Big Data (BD) is being increasingly used in a variety of
industries including construction. Yet, little research exists that has
examined the factors which drive BD adoption in construction. The
purpose of this paper is to address this gap in knowledge.
Design/methodology/approach Data collected from literature (55 articles)
were analyzed using content analysis techniques. Taking a two-pronged
approach, first study presents a systematic perspective of literature on
BD in construction. Then underpinned by
technology-organization-environment theory and supplemented by
literature, a conceptual model of five antecedent factors of BD adoption
for use in construction is proposed. Findings The results show that BD
adoption in construction is driven by a number of factors: first,
technological: augmented BD-BIM integration and BD relative advantage;
second, organizational: improved design and execution efficiencies, and
improved project management capabilities; and third, environmental:
augmented availability of BD-related technology for construction.
Hypothetical relationships involving these factors are then developed
and presented through a new model of BD adoption in construction.
Research limitations/implications - The study proposes a number of
adoption factors and then builds a new conceptual model advancing
theories on technologies adoption in construction. Practical
implications - Findings will help managers (e.g. chief information
officers, IT/IS managers, business and senior managers) to understand
the factors that drive adoption of BD in construction and plan their own
BD adoption. Results will help policy makers in developing policy
guidelines to create sustainable environment for the adoption of BD for
enhanced economic, social and environmental benefits. Originality/value

facades is the ability to reduce cooling thermal loads. The natural
convection in the air chambers and the protection against solar
incidence provided by the external layer reduces the energy consumed by
the artificial systems used for environmental conditioning (HVAC
systems). This research investigates the energy benefit of opaque
ventilated facades compared to cladding facades in mull-floor
residential buildings located in nine climate zones, according to the
Koeppen-Geiger classification, in Brazil. To this end, computational
simulations using software from the same company, capable of
automatically synchronizing the modeling data and energy analysis of a

different locations was determined in order to analyze the cost-benefit
of the system against the yearly energy benefits. The greatest energy
benefits, as well as the best cost-benefits, were found in the hottest
regions, demonstrating that this system is relevant for the climate
conditions in Brazil and its use should be encouraged since the largest
area of the country is located in hot climate zones. Despite the similar
results found for cities in the same climate regions, there were also
significant differences among them so an individual analysis taking into
account the influence of wind speed and rainfall should be performed as
well. The study evaluated a wide sampling, 16 cities from all climatic
zones, unlike the current studies that were conducted between 2010 and
2018 in Europe, having as main contribution the analysis of an entire
building over the period of one year, becoming the most complete
research to date, conducted with great speed enabled by the adopted
computer simulation methods. This research shows that the behavior of
ventilated facade is an improvement in terms of passive cooling of the
building compared to cladding facades, offering energy electric savings

Findings Findings of this study revealed that PSTs and FM applications
form a many-to-many mapping, i.e. one PST could facilitate many FM
applications, and one application can also be supported by various PSTs.
It is also found that energy modeling and management is the most
referred purpose in FM to adopt PSTs, while space management, albeit
important, received the least attention. Five challenges are identified,
which include high investment on PSTs, data storage problem, absence of
proper data exchange protocols for data interoperability, a lack of
mature data processing methods for data utilization and privacy of

warming and climate change. As the construction and demolition waste
(CDW) end of life disposal process is a source of GHG emissions, it is
vital to precisely estimate and reduce CDW end of life GHG emissions.
The precise estimation of CDW information is essential for GHG
estimation and reduction. However, as current CDW information and
associated GHG estimation methods tend to be inaccurate, in this paper,
a building information modeling (BIM)-based CDW information management
system (IMS) is constructed that provides precise CDW information and a
detailed information estimation process. To facilitate the accurate
quantification of CDW disposal GHG emissions, mathematical formulae that
include several GHG emission factors are proposed. A practical case
study from China is then given to demonstrate the efficiency and
effectiveness of the proposed methodology in quantifying and reducing
CDW disposal GHG emissions. Accurate GHG emission estimation are
determined for fifteen CDW disposal types and a comparison are
conducted. Concrete was found to have the highest carbon dioxide,
methane, and nitrous oxide emissions during transportation and the
highest carbon dioxide emissions during handling, and organics were
found to have the highest decomposition methane emissions. Targeted
suggestions are given for source-separated CDW disposal GHG emission
reduction based on the different emission characteristics. The
combination of the BIM -based CDW IMS and the developed mathematical
formulae were found to efficiently and accurately determine the CDW

identifying and implementing carbon mitigation and reduction strategies.
A comprehensive study to map global research on carbon emissions is,
however, not available. Therefore, based on a scientometric analysis
method, this study reviewed the global literature on carbon emissions. A
total of 2945 bibliographic records, from 1981 to 2019, were extracted
from the Web of Science core collection database and analyzed using
techniques such as co-author and co-citation analysis. Findings revealed
an increasing trend of publications in the carbon emission research
domain, which has been more visible in the past few years, especially
during 2016-2018. The most significant contribution to the domain was
reported from China, the United States, and England. While most prolific
authors and institutions of the domain were from China, authors and
institutions from the United States reported the best connection links.
It was revealed that evaluating greenhouse gas emissions and estimating
the carbon footprint was popular among the researchers. Moreover,
climate change and environmental effects of carbon emissions were also
significant points of concern in carbon emission research. The key
findings of this study will be beneficial for the policymakers,
academics, and institutions to determine the future research directions
as well as to identify with whom they can consult to assist in
developing carbon emission control policies and future carbon reduction
targets.},

abstract = {Apartment buildings are the most common housing typology in South Korea.
The mass construction of apartment neighborhoods during a period of
rapid economic growth (1970-1997) involved the minimization of material
use and quality, as well as industrialized construction processes.
Accordingly, apartment buildings require essential renovation after only
20 years of operation. This study focuses on the improvement of thermal
comfort for the renovation of an exemplary apartment building based on
an integrated Building Information Modeling (BIM) and parametric
software framework. The existing apartment was reconstructed with BIM
software, and the virtual model was utilized for a parametric building
energy simulation to calculate the thermal comfort condition of
occupants during the entire year. The thermal comfort analysis results
defined the criteria for the development of an enhanced building
envelope system characterized by modular panels. The parametric energy
simulation was executed for the renovated apartment condition with the
enhanced envelope system, and the thermal comfort improvements were
quantified by comparing the results for the apartment condition before
and after renovation. This study aims to provide the tools and criteria
for the comfort analysis of apartment occupants, as well as propose
sustainable solutions for the improvement of thermal comfort in aged
buildings with similar conditions, internal distribution, and
construction components.},

from important barriers, such as the fragmentation of the value chain,
the lack of information regarding some solutions, and the lack of
confidence with respect to energy savings, which prevent unlocking
investments, and the difficult communication among stakeholders.
Therefore, new processes based on exploiting the potential of existing

developed a tool that integrates stakeholders, data and tools in order
to ease the process of designing energy efficient retrofitting projects
at building and district scale. This tool works around an optimisation
framework in order to evaluate, compare and optimise candidate
retrofitting scenarios against a set of indicators showing the
performance of the district. This evaluation and optimisation method is
based on aggregating indicators through transforming the priorities of
stakeholders into a mathematical weighting scheme, which makes it
possible to provide scenarios within their expectations. Therefore, the
generation of these scenarios is driven by their design parameters,
being thus flexible and adapted to their needs. This paper shows the
implementation of this tool and specifically 3 different prioritisation
schemes, analysing how they impact into the decision making process and
selection of the retrofitting strategy.},

content analyses and examine global patterns among publications,
including the distribution of core authors and institutions,
high-frequency categories and keywords, journal and author

deeply qualitative analysis on the 127 identified papers, five
mainstream research topics in EPC were summarized, covering
implementations of EPC, mechanisms for effective EPC projects,
stakeholder behaviors and decisions in EPC projects, energy service
company (ESCO) in EPC projects, and risk management in EPC. In addition,
six main research gaps in EPC were identified, including lack of
effective measurement and verification of energy savings, limited
studies on EPC projects in the residential sector, ineffective
mechanisms to ensure post-EPC energy-saving, limited research on the
dual relationships among EPC project stakeholders, how to improve the
energy users' (EU) attitudes/cognitions toward ESCO/EPC, and lack of
effective mechanisms to prevent risks in EPC projects. Furthermore,
based on the current EPC research topics and research gaps in EPC, six
potential research directions in EPC in future were also explored, which
are how to develop effective methods for measuring and verifying energy

mechanisms to ensure post-EPC energy-saving, effects of cooperative and
competitive relationships between EU and ESCO on the performance of EPC

abstract = {There is a growing concern in society for the environmental impacts of a
built environment. In this regard, the use of building information
modelling (BIM) tools has arisen as a new trend in the construction
industry to improve the sustainable assessments of buildings in the
design phase. For that purpose, current approaches either focus on the
use of BIM together with several programs, or solely use it for an
automatic quantity take-off. However, as noted in the literature, the
lack of semantic information within BIM models can lead to ineffective
decision-making processes and models that are unsuitable for the
operation and maintenance stages. Therefore, the present study explores
the potential of BIM as a repository for the life cycle assessment (LCA)
and life cycle costing (LCC) information, and how that information
should be used for an environmental and economic analysis. By doing so,
the authors intend to discuss the potential of BIM as a data repository
and its capacity for supporting an automatic/semi-automatic
environmental and economic assessment.
A BIM-LCA/LCC framework was proposed, which led to the development of an
information delivery manual and a model view definition (IDM/MVD), using
the industry foundation classes (IFC) schema, for the integration and
exchange of information within a BIM-based environment. Finally, the
authors implemented the proposed framework with a case study. It is
observed that, although most recent IFC schemes already consider some of
the required information, a considerable number of properties are still
required to conduct a comprehensive LCA and LCC analysis. Thus, the work
presented here contributes to the existing background knowledge
necessary for future implementations of BIM-based LCA/LCC and for
software developers to develop a suitable BIM-LCA/LCC tool.},

along the lifecycle supported by BIM allows an overall better management

interoperability must consider not only data, but also should be
concerned with broader aspects, such as processes and guidelines,
avoiding information loss, facilitating analysis, and therefore,
improving sustainability. In the light of this scenario, a systematic
literature review was performed considering sustainability factors,
interoperability concerns and lifecycle stages. This review was based on
existing methods complemented by a multicriteria decision analysis
method to aid the selection of relevant papers. Also, a qualitative data
analysis was performed to identify the relations of the fields studied.
Results showed that even though some fields receive much attention in
the literature, few studies are performed considering interoperability

the relevant connections among lifecycle stages and sustainability
fields, providing an influence matrix of these two areas. This review

efficiency of seven million British homes by 2020, aiming at reducing
carbon emissions and addressing fuel poverty. One alternative to achieve
better energy performance in existing houses is retrofit. However, there
are difficulties associated with retrofitting social housing. It is
currently challenging to compare scenarios (retrofit options)
considering costs, potential energy efficiency gains, and at the same
time minimising disruption to users. This paper presents a Building
Information Modelling (BIM) protocol aimed to support decision making by
social housing owners. It adopts BIM to simulate alternative retrofit
options, considering: (a) potential reductions in energy consumption,
(b) 4D BIM for retrofit planning and reduction of users' disruption and
(c) simulation of costs. A what-if scenario matrix is proposed to
support decision making in the selection of social housing retrofit
solutions, according to client and users' needs. A case study of the
retrofit of a mid-terrace house is presented to demonstrate the
workflow. The main output of the work is the BIM protocol, which can
support client decision making in diverse social housing retrofit
projects, considering all three elements (energy simulation, planning
for reduced disruption and cost estimation) in an integrated fashion.
Such an integrated approach enables clients to make better informed

point temperatures, the radiative properties of plasters, the
thermo-physical properties of envelope components, the window type, the
building orientation. The GA performs a Pareto optimization and finally
two optimal solutions are recommended: the nZEB (nearly zero energy
building) optimal solution, which minimizes PEC, and the cost-optimal
solution, which minimizes GC. These solutions provide the optimal design
strategies for the public and private stakeholders, respectively, which
represent the main actors involved in building design. The approach is
applied for the design of a new typical Italian residential building.
Four locations are considered to investigate the typical Italian
climates. The outcomes can give precious indications to rebuild the
Italian residential stock with a view to energy-efficiency and
cost-optimality, given that the optimal solutions provide low values of

uncertainty in the early design stage, a probability function was
assigned to each material. At the detailed design stage, all material

abstract = {A ``performance gap{\{}''{\}} arises when the actual value of building energy
consumption during the operational phase deviates from the value
predicted using simulation during the design phase. One cause of this
performance gap is that operation is not ideal, as assumed in the
simulation, and the control of the heating, ventilating, and air
conditioning (HVAC) system is not optimized. These problems occur
because the operator has not been trained sufficiently and/or the
building automation system is not working as intended by the developer.
Both problems are fundamentally caused by the fact that the quality of
building operation cannot be quantitatively evaluated by comparison with
other buildings because a building is a heterogenous, single-item
product. To address the performance gap problem, we developed a method
for quantitatively evaluating building operation using a precise
simulation based on a thermal environment emulator. The emulator
software was developed using the BACnet protocol as an interface to the
real world and includes an occupant behavior model to enable the
assessment of operation in terms of thermal comfort as well as energy
performance. In this paper, we report on the program and network
structure of the proposed emulator. In addition, we show the concrete
results of changing the operational control, and we assess changes in
energy performance and comfort from the perspective of Pareto
efficiency.},

abstract = {With increasing awareness of the contribution of buildings to global
warming, the construction industry has begun to be more responsive to
energy-efficient buildings. The emergence of building information
modeling (BIM) with building energy modeling (BEM) provides industry
with means to address related issues through integrated energy analysis
of buildings. Nevertheless, connecting BIM technology to BEM includes
issues of information exchange among the participants in the process.
While the prevailing view in the literature is that there is a need to
redefine the process, it is suggested that beyond that the success of
BEM includes stakeholder management, which can be implemented through
BIM's social capabilities. Therefore, in order to address the
integration issues between them, this study proposes a social concept
for connecting BIM to BEM, which is reflected in the model for
implementation of corporate social responsibility (CSR) through BIM for
BEM (CSR-BIM-BEM model). The examination of the relevance of BIM's
social capabilities to the BEM process according to this model was
conducted on three levels. First, the implications of integrating BIM
technology into the BEM process were examined through expert interviews,
and the need for social perception became apparent. Second, the
examination of the model's criteria by the experts supported its ability
to promote the BEM process. Third, an examination of two case studies
proved, using social network analysis and participant interviews, the
model's feasibility, in terms of BEM process parameters. A direct link
was found between BIM's management centrality, reflected in BIM
involvement in stakeholder management, and progress in the BEM process.
These results illustrate the importance of BIM's social role in building
energy modeling.

abstract = {Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a suitable method to analyse and improve
the environmental impact of buildings. However, it is complex to apply
in the design phase. Building Information Modelling (BIM) can help to
perform LCA during the design process. Current BIM-LCA approaches follow
two trends. Either they use complex models in detailed design phases,
when it is late for major changes, or they are based on simplified
approaches only applicable in early design stages. This paper proposes a
novel method for applying LCA continuously over the entire building
design process to assess the embodied environmental impacts by using the
data provided by BIM with as much accuracy as possible in each stage.
The method uses different LCA databases with different levels of detail
for the specific level of development (LOD) of the BIM. Since different
building elements are not modelled with identical LODs in each design
phase, the assessment of embodied environmental impacts is conducted by
consistently mixing the LCA databases, which is possible as long as the
databases use identical background data. The method is applied to five
design stages of a building case study. The results show that it is now
possible to calculate the embodied impacts in all design stages while
being consistent with the results from the completed project. The
environmental impact in a certain design phase is always within the
range of variability of the previous phase. Therefore, the method allows
to estimate the final embodied environmental impact with increasing
accuracy and by that provide information for decision-making throughout
the whole design process. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The building design process is crucial in efforts to implement
energy-efficient practices by adopting Energy Efficiency Measures
(EEMs). However, design choices based solely on reducing operational
energy use can significantly increase a building's embodied energy and
Life Cycle Energy (LCE) use, because there is a trade-off between
embodied and operational energy. This article presents a case study in
which multi-objective optimization was used to explore the effects of
various EEMs on the aforementioned trade-off. Optimal solution(s) for
six different building shapes (rectangular, H-, U-, L-, T- and
cross-shaped) based on two sets of EEMs were investigated and compared.
The first set of EEMs consisted of EEMs that can be implemented or
modified during the early design phase, such as the building's shape,
orientation, Window to Wall Ratio (WWR), and constituent materials. The
second set comprised EEMs that can be implemented later in the design
phase (i.e. EEMs relating to the constituent materials). The LCE
reductions achieved by finding optimal solutions for EEMs in the first
set (ranged from 2175.2 to 3803.8 GJ) were significantly (over 5 times)
higher than those achieved for the second set (ranged from 418.6 to
625.6 GJ) for all building shapes. Moreover, LCE use for
pre-optimization building designs varied significantly with building
shape. However, after optimization, the differences in LCE use between
the optimal solutions of different building shapes were modest. This
means that designers and construction companies can select building
shapes based on customer requirements, but also highlights the
importance of using multi-objective optimization during early design
process to identify optimal combinations of EEMs that minimize LCE use.

abstract = {Aiming at the high-performance operation requirements of a bearingless
induction motor (BIM), a direct levitation force control strategy based
on model prediction for the BIM is proposed. Based on mathematical
models of the BIM, the flux linkage at the next moment is predicted
according to the current observation value of the flux linkage of
levitation force winding, and the objective function of the flux linkage
is constructed to output the optimal flux linkage. Inverter drive
control signals are generated from the SVPWM module to control the BIM
levitation. In addition, to deal with the problem of the initial error
caused by reverse electromotive force integration in the traditional
observation of flux linkage during the process of motor control, an
improved flux observer is introduced and applied to the control system.
The simulation and experimental results show that the proposed control
strategy cannot only effectively improve the suspension stability of the
rotor, but also enhance the anti-disturbance ability of the system in
comparison to the traditional levitation force control. In the meantime,
it has a good dynamic and static performance which verifies the
effectiveness and reliability of the proposed control strategy.},

abstract = {Purpose Buildings and their construction activities consume a
significant proportion of mineral resources excavated from nature and
contribute a large percentage of CO2 in the atmosphere. As a way of
improving the sustainability of building construction and operation,
various sustainable design appraisal standards have been developed
across nations. Albeit criticism of the appraisal standards, evidence
shows that increasing sustainability of the built environment has been
engendered by such appraisal tools as Building Research Establishment
Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM), Code for Sustainable Homes
(CfSH), Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design and Comprehensive
Assessment System for Built Environment Efficacy, among others. The
purpose of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of the appraisal
standards in engendering whole lifecycle environmental sustainability of
the built environment.
Design/methodology/approach In order to evaluate the adequacy of
sustainability scores assigned to various lifecycle stages of buildings
in the appraisal standards, four case studies of a block of classroom
were modelled. Using Revit as a modelling platform, stage by stage
lifecycle environmental impacts of the building were simulated through
Green Building Studio and ATHENA Impact estimator. The resulting
environmental impacts were then compared against the assessment score
associated with each stage of building lifecycle in BREAAM and CfSH.
Findings Results show that albeit the consensus that the appraisal
standards engender sustainability practices in the AEC industry, total
scores assigned to impacts at each stage of building lifecycle is
disproportionate to the simulated whole-life environmental impacts
associated with the stages in some instances.
Originality/value As the study reveals both strengths and weaknesses in
the existing sustainability appraisal standards, measures through which
they can be tailored to resource efficiency and lifecycle environmental
sustainability of the built environment are suggested.},

global energy demand and the availability of fossil fuels constantly on
the decline, there is a need to ensure that this energy demand is
efficiently and effectively managed using renewable energy now more than
ever. Most research and case studies have focused on energy efficiency
of ``new' buildings. In this study, both technical and financial
viability of Net Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) for ``existing' buildings
will be highlighted. A rigorous review of open literatures concerning
seven principal areas that in themselves define the concept of NZEB
building is carried out. In practice, a suitable option of the NZEB
solutions is needed for the evaluation and improvement for a specific
geographical area. The evaluation and improvement has been carried out
using a novel hierarchy-flow chart coupled with a Building Information
Model (BIM). This BIM or digital twin is then used to thoroughly
visualize each option, promote collaboration among stakeholders, and
accurately estimate associated costs and associated technical issues
encountered with producing an NZEB in a pre-determined location. This
paper also provides a future model for NZEB applications in existing
buildings, which applies renewable technologies to the building by
aiming to identify ultimate benefit of the building especially in terms
of effectiveness and efficiency in energy consumption. It is revealed
that the digital twin is proven to be feasible for all renewable
technologies applied on the NZEB buildings. Based on the case study in
the UK, it can be affirmed that the suitable NZEB solution for an

and therefore contributes significantly to climate change. A study of
not only the use of energy during the operation but also the associated
consumption and emissions in the life cycle is required. One way to
reduce life cycle energy consumption is through retro-fitting existing
buildings. This study analysed the energy consumption and its greenhouse
gas emissions after applying five sustainable retrofit measures. For
this purpose, two typical neighbourhood dwellings were chosen, located
in the city of Vitoria, in the state of Espirito Santo, Brazil. The
analysis was conducted for the pre-operational and operational stages.
Using pre-established standards, the energy of the building materials
that compose the dwellings was calculated as well as the consumed
operational energy. The labelling of the building envelopes was also
verified, according to the simulation method specified by the Technical
Quality Requirements for Energy Efficiency Levels of Residential
Buildings (RTQ-R). The software programme used to calculate performance
was EnergyPlus. The results indicated that adopting all retrofit
measures yielded improvements in the life cycle for only one building,
namely, a 15{\%} reduction in energy consumption and a payback time of
10.4 years. Although these results are lower than those reported in some
international studies, the analysis showed significant improvements in

abstract = {In December 2012, EniServizi (the Italian multinational energy company),
after the Earthquake that occurred at L'Aquila in April 2009, decided to
undertake the project Re-start from Collemaggio, funding around 14
million Euro to restore the Basilica di Collemaggio. EniServizi, aware
of the BIM potential role in the complex building and infrastructure
domain in the world, required an advanced HBIM based on laser scanner
and photogrammetric surveying to address decision-making processes among
the different actors involved in the preservation process. The Basilica
of Collemaggio has been re-opened to the public on December 2017. This
paper tries to make a synthesis of the different lessons learnt, in
relation to both positive and critical aspects relating HBIM
feasibility, sustainability and usefulness to the challenging
restoration and preservation field. The theoretical and practical HBIM
approach here tackled overcomes the current BIM logic based on the
sequential process adopted by the AIA and NBS Level of Development
(LOD), characterized by a simple-to-complex-detailing process, working
in the new construction domain and generally following the
conceptualizing phase, the preliminary design, the executive design, the
construction phase till to the facility management. A complex-mixed LOD
approach, able to entail the richness, unicity and multiplicity of each
component and to get the maximum degree of knowledge, has been
experimented in order to derive informed decisions in terms of
preservation, restoration and management since the starting phases of
the architectural design. To this aim, a Level of Geometry (LOG)
coherent to the Level of Accuracy gained by the high-resolution surveys
has been adapted to the specificity of the restoration process of a
historic monument and is here proposed through different Grade of
Generation (GOG) protocols developed in the object modelling to support
the preliminary and definitive design proposal of the conservation plan
of the Basilica. Particularly, a NURBS-based parametric generative
modelling process (GOG9-10) is here proposed in order to get models BIM
abled to describe the complex geometry and to match the related
information. Specific Level of Information (LOI) has been introduced to
support the preservation process, to document the as-built and the
management of the building after the intervention, moving HBIM toward
multi-actor domain. Given the effort required by such approach,
obtaining a cost-effective HBIM modelling embodying the complexity of
each damaged element as acquired by the surveys (i.e. walls, pillars,
vaults, beams) represents a challenging issue. The result of the overall
process aims to contribute in lowering the initial HBIM modelling costs
by deploying a sustainable complexity delivering protocols and
specification and by boosting at the same time an interoperable
cooperative HBIM habit among multi-actors across all the phases,
spreading its usability after the restoration process. On the lesson
learnt, the process of updating the current Codification criteria
(UNI11337-2009) has been started with a draft proposal stimulating the
debate for the future of HBIM adoption in the case of restoration,
preservation and maintenance (UNI11337-2017): in the conviction that
transferring the HBIM richness into the Life Cycle Management process
will allow multi-actors to take in account the knowledge and information
gained during the restoration, integrating the as-built updating and
keeping updated the monument monitoring during the time being.},

commissioning and operational compromises. Some important factors are
firmly rooted in the lack of interoperability around building
information. New solutions to the interoperability challenge offer the
potential to leverage and reuse available heterogeneous data in a manner
that can significantly assist building performance assessment. Linked
data provides an open, modular and extensible solution for the
challenge. However, in the buildings domain, the integration of
rule-based performance metrics and contextual information has yet to be
formally established. This paper describes an approach to the provision
of in-depth building performance assessment through the integration of
OpenMath and linked data. An ontology describing performance metrics in
RDF is presented, together with an automated metric evaluation solution
using multi-silo queries and computer algebra systems, providing a
flexible, automated and extensible mechanism for the assessment of
building performance. Building managers and engineers can simultaneously
analyse time-series building performance at a range of levels, without
burdensome manual intervention such as is the case with traditional
solutions. A test implementation on a large university building
highlights the potential of this solution. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All

gained widespread attention. While the application of different DTs in
facility management (FM) has been growing, to date, there is no holistic
review of the various DT developments and research into FM. A total of
120 academic journal papers, conference proceedings and other technical
notes published on the subject, mainly between 2004 and 2017, were
reviewed in this paper. The applications of various major DTs, including
1) building information modelling (BIM), 2) reality capture technology
(including 3D laser scanning, point cloud), 3) the Internet of Things
(IoT) (including radio frequency identification (RFID) and sensor
network technologies) and 4) geographic information system (GIS), were
reviewed and scrutinised. The review identified a number of
possibilities for future research into DT in FM, including, enhancing
the interoperability of data, improving the accuracy of point cloud data
for developing as built models for existing facilities, and generating
effective BIM/GIS asset database integration. It is hoped that this
review and the future directions highlighted in this paper will assist
researchers in identifying the areas where further research efforts are
most required and in identifying which future directions would be most

environmental impacts of buildings need to be reduced significantly, and
that Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a methodology well suited to support
this. The importance of evaluating potential improvements to the
environmental life cycle performance of buildings in early design stages
is widely acknowledged; the wide application of LCA during design
however, is restrained by the great uncertainty in design and material

stage, we propose an approach using Building Information Modeling (BIM)
to assess a wide range of construction options and their embodied
environmental impact. We use a conceptual BIM model to evaluate a
variety of material compositions for different building elements and the
potential contribution of elements to the total embodied impact of the
building design. The BIM-integrated approach enables identification of
design specific hotspots which can be visualized on the building model
for communication of LCA results and visual design guidance.},

abstract = {There is an increasing impetus for the use of digital city models and
sensor network data to understand the current demand for utility
resources and inform future infrastructure service planning across a
range of spatial scales. Achieving this requires the ability to
represent a city as a complex system of connected and interdependent
components in which the topology of the electricity, water, gas, and
heat demand-supply networks are modelled in an integrated manner.
However, integrated modelling of these networks is hampered by the
disparity between the predominant data formats and modelling processes
used in the Geospatial Information Science (GIS) and Building
Information Modelling (BIM) domains. This paper presents a software
systems approach to scale-free, multi-format, integrated modelling of
evolving cross-domain utility infrastructure network topologies, and the
analysis of the spatiotemporal dynamics of their resource flows. The
system uses a graph database to integrate the topology of utility
network components represented in the CityGML UtilityNetwork Application
Domain Extension (ADE), Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and JavaScript
Object Notation (JSON) real-time streaming messages. A message broker is
used to disseminate the changing state of the integrated topology and
the dynamic resource flows derived from the streaming data. The
capability of the developed system is demonstrated via a case study in
which internal building and local electricity distribution feeder
networks are integrated, and a real-time building management sensor data
stream is used to simulate and visualise the spatiotemporal dynamics of
electricity flows using a dynamic web-based visualisation.},

quantifies attenuated signal loss. Also, we construct an attenuation

requires a relevant quota of the total energy demand of HVAC systems,
especially when the ventilation demand is significant. A correct energy
saving strategy therefore should always focus on the use of suitable
techniques to reduce this energy consumption. As proved by the modern
theories on comfort, less strict values can be accepted for the internal
humidity set points without compromising indoor comfort conditions. In
addition, Demand Controlled Ventilation (DCV) gives the opportunity to
reduce energy requirements. This paper investigates the opportunities
offered by the installation of a DCV system and a Building Management
System (BMS) able to perform long term monitoring of the HVAC system in
a real case study. This refers to a historic building in Venice in the

optimization of the control strategies and simple tuning actions of the

in absence of self-learning control systems, as well as they highlight
the achievement of remarkable energy savings thanks to these actions.

abstract = {Virtual 3D city models are increasingly being used to model the realms
of the real world for utilization in a number of applications related to
environmental simulations including, urban planning, mapping the energy
characteristics of buildings, noise mapping, flood modelling, etc. Apart
from geometric and appearance/textural information, these applications
have a requirement for complex urban semantics. Currently, a number of
3D standards are available in CAD, BIM and GIS related domains for the
storage, visualization and transfer of 3D geospatial datasets.
Initially, the 3D data models (such as COLLADA, VRML, X3D, etc.) were
purely graphical/geometrical in nature and mainly used for visualization
purposes. With the inclusion of thematic modules in OGC CityGML, the
integration of geometry and semantics in a single data model paved the
way for better sharing of virtual 3D city models. In spite of the
availability of a wide range of 3D data standards, there are certain
differences with respect to geometry, topology, semantics, LODs, etc.,
which complicates the integration of 3D geodata from heterogeneous
sources. This paper serves to highlights the need for the innovative
solutions with respect to the urban environmental related simulations
primarily based on the use of virtual 3D city models. Four use cases are
studied in this context namely, (1) urban solar potential estimation
using CityGML models, (2) simulation of traffic noise level mapped on
building walls from the urban road segments, (3) CityGML based 3D data
models interoperability, and (4) 3D indoor logistics and subsurface
utilities. However, for modelling majority of use cases, CityGML does
not provide explicit thematic representations but provides support for
extending the CityGML schema using Application Domain Extensions. In a
nutshell, the study explores the semantic modelling capabilities of the
CityGML for the transformation of native 3D virtual city models to one
satisfying capabilities like semantic information and support towards
interoperability.},

abstract = {Buildings consume nearly 40{\%} of primary energy production globally.
Certified green buildings substantially reduce energy consumption on a
per square foot basis and they also focus on indoor environmental
quality. However, the co-benefits to health through reductions in energy
and concomitant reductions in air pollution have not been examined. We
calculated year by year LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental
Design) certification rates in six countries (the United States, China,
India, Brazil, Germany, and Turkey) and then used data from the Green
Building Information Gateway (GBIG) to estimate energy savings in each
country each year. Of the green building rating schemes, LEED accounts
for 32{\%} of green-certified floor space and publically reports energy
efficiency data. We employed Harvard's Co-BE Calculator to determine
pollutant emissions reductions by country accounting for transient
energy mixes and baseline energy use intensities. Co-BE applies the
social cost of carbon and the social cost of atmospheric release to
translate these reductions into health benefits. Based on modeled energy
use, LEED-certified buildings saved {\$}7.5B in energy costs and averted
33MT of CO2, 51kt of SO2, 38kt of NOx, and 10 kt of PM2.5 from entering
the atmosphere, which amounts to {\$}5.8B (lower limit = {\$}2.3B, upper
limit = {\$}9.1B) in climate and health co-benefits from 2000 to 2016 in
the six countries investigated. The U.S. health benefits derive from
avoiding an estimated 172-405 premature deaths, 171 hospital admissions,
11,000 asthma exacerbations, 54,000 respiratory symptoms, 21,000 lost
days of work, and 16,000 lost days of school. Because the climate and
health benefits are nearly equivalent to the energy savings for green
buildings in the United States, and up to 10 times higher in developing
countries, they provide an important and previously unquantified
societal value. Future analyses should consider these co-benefits when
weighing policy decisions around energy-efficient buildings.},

certain given the value it offers. This certainly will benefit
construction akin to the manufacturing and the retail industry alike.
Nevertheless, a review of the literature suggested a limited coverage on
the potential application of big data in construction as compared to
other industries. This limits understanding of its potential, where the
industry is seemingly unaware thus could not relate and extract its real
value. Hence, this study aims to draw insights on the specific areas of

analyse the current extent of construction big data research; (2) to map
out the orientation of the current construction big data research; and
(3) to suggest the current directions of construction big data research.
The qualitative method through a desk study approach has been carried
out to attain the first two objectives. It involved a structured review
process which covered articles from the online databases assisted by the
Nvivo software. This resulted in the theoretical orientation which was
conceptualized as: (1) project management; (2) safety (3) energy

process will form the basis to suggest the prospective directions of
research on big data in construction. This exploration is substantial as
a precursor to a much deeper study on big data. As big data is set to

abstract = {Building demolition waste presents a significant challenge due to its
large scale. Especially, the treatment of waste (i.e. demolition,
collection, sorting, transportation, recycling and landfill) has
environmental implications, e.g. carbon emissions due to energy consumed
by equipment and vehicles. Therefore, it is imperative to identify the
appropriate waste treatment methods with low carbon emissions. However,
previous studies predominately focused on quantifying the carbon
emission of buildings. In contrast, the carbon emission derived from the
treatment of building demolition waste is largely overlooked. A
conceptual framework is developed in this study to facilitate the
assessment of carbon emissions over the life cycle of building
demolition waste. In this conceptual framework, Building Information
Modelling provides an effective approach to harvest data and feed into
the Life Cycle Assessment. Case study of a high-rise residential
building was conducted to showcase how this framework can be implemented
in practice. Results showed that the environmental benefit derived from
recycling of building demolition waste varies from one material to
another. The recycling of metal waste has far higher environmental
benefits compared to masonry wastes. In particular, aluminum could
contribute to as high as 45{\%} of carbon emission reduction despite only
accounting for 0.66{\%} of the total weight. Across various lifecycle
stages, the onsite collection and sorting is the biggest contributor to
the total carbon emission. In addition, on-site recycling has better
performance compared to factory recycling and landfill in terms of
carbon emissions. Furthermore, a large scale inventories are developed
as an outcome of this case study. These findings provide useful inputs
to the future endeavor of building demolition waste recycling in a bid
to reduce the associated carbon emissions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to describe the process through
which an organization develops organizational capabilities by tapping
the technical skills and social skills of its employees in the use of
Building Information Modeling (BIM) to deliver lean and green project
outcomes. The resulting framework for BIM-based organizational
capabilities development comprising of three hierarchical layers -
technology, process and outcomes - is explained.
Design/methodology/approach For this study, BIM has been identified as
an enabler and a process for achieving lean and green outcomes on
construction projects. Based on a detailed literature review, this paper
identifies the organizational capabilities needed by the architecture,
engineering and construction organizations to effectively implement BIM
on construction projects. The study has been conducted through a
sequential mixed-method approach involving semi-structured interviews,
focus groups and qualitative comparative analyses.
Findings It was discovered that to attain desired project outcomes, an
organization needs to embrace an underlying BIM adoption culture not
only within its project teams but also within the organization as a
whole. The study also concluded that an integrated approach to BIM usage
- connecting it with lean and green initiatives - on construction
projects resulted in improved project outcomes, especially ones
targeting lean and green aspects of improvements.
Practical implications The proposed outline for BIM-based organizational
capabilities will help the organizations focus on the human factors
along with the technical factors while striving for successful usage
within their organizations.
Originality/value Using the organizational capabilities matrix, this
paper highlights the importance of technical and social skill sets of an
individual employee and their role in developing the organizational

Findings The results showed that the key drivers for using data mining
within the AEC sector is associated with the sustainability, process

abstract = {Despite the apparent simplicity of existing BIM-LCA tools, there is a
lack of integration with the main BIM software, and the double-effort of
design development and parallel simulations is a barrier to their
implementation in the design process. Moreover, simplifications on these
tools may provide misleading results to the designer. The main aim of
this research is to develop an integration interface of
manufacturer-based LCA data into a BIM platform by combining
applications of existing and consolidated tools (namely, Autodesk Revit
and Dynamo, and Microsoft Excel), in order to obtain environmental
profiles for decision-making in the initial design stages, requiring
less time, effort and ad hoc experts. The methodological procedures were
aggregated into the following system development and testing phases: (a)
input data organization, (b) creating new parameters on BIM software,
(c) visual programming, (d) results analysis for decision-making and (e)
simulation of social housing. The results of the developed tool provided
complete results automatically, not requiring the designer to make
changes in the software or interfaces. Some limitations were identified
during development and application, due to the lack of LCA data
availability by manufacturers, the complexity of data programming
importation and extraction on BIM software for different construction
subsystems, and the complexity of LCA results analysis and understanding
encountered by non-experts. Regarding the latter, the research concluded
that broad knowledge dissemination is still necessary to improve

the overall cost and environmental performance of buildings and
infrastructure. However, the current approach often fails to consider
the multi-perspectives of structural design, such as safety,
environmental issues and cost in a comprehensive way. This paper
presents a holistic approach based on knowledge processing (ontology) to
facilitate a smarter decision-making process for early design stage by
informing designers of the environmental impact and cost along with
safety considerations. The approach can give a reasoning based
quantitative understanding of how the design alternatives using
different concrete materials can affect the ultimate overall
performance. Embodied CO2 and cost are both considered along with safety
criteria as indicative multi-perspectives to demonstrate the novelty of
the approach. A case study of a concrete structural frame is used to
explain how the proposed method can be used by structural designers when
taking multi performance criteria into account. The major contribution
of the paper lies on the creation of a holistic knowledge base which
links through different knowledge across sectors to enable the
structural engineer to come up with much more comprehensive decisions

abstract = {The need to overcome challenges faced by construction industry has been
at the core of many government reports. Most of the reports suggest the
adoption of innovations including off-site manufacture and emerging
Building Information Modelling (BIM) to overcome the challenges facing
the industry. Current research has largely focused on the impacts of
off-site manufacture and BIM independently applied on traditional
construction methods. Due to the factory-based nature of off-site
manufacture, the benefits of BIM on off-site manufacture have been
widely argued to be far greater than those of traditional construction.
However, studies about impacts of BIM on off-site manufacture are scarce
with far too many on traditional construction. This study investigates
the implications of BIM systems on off-site manufacture and traditional
construction methods, with emphasis on the technological potential of
BIM for off-site manufacture. The specific objectives of the study are
threefold. Firstly, it examines how BIM can support off-site
manufacture. Secondly, the paper discusses the benefits of BIM and
explains how BIM can overcome barriers hindering the uptake of off-site
manufacturing. Thirdly, due to the importance to measure the benefits to
support wider adoption, an examination of the published quantitative
benefits of BIM on off-site manufacture and traditional construction is
undertaken. A critical appraisal of the literature was undertaken to
achieve the aim of this study. The main findings are the identification
of qualitative and quantitative benefits of: BIM on off-site
manufacture, off-site manufacture and BIM on traditional construction.
The findings reinforce the argument that BIM adoption on off-site
manufacturing projects is a rapid, efficient and one of the best ways to
improve on the long standing challenges that have plagued the
construction industry for generations.},

abstract = {Contemporary precast large-panel buildings, due to their precise
production, the usage of new generation materials and the latest
technological solutions in the field of joints, allow on production of
safe, functional and aestetics buildings. Prefabrication shorten time of
building implementation, as well as make it possible to build in
difficult conditions. It should be underlined, that this technology
promotes construction of environmentally friendly structures throughout
their lifecycle starting from reduction of CO2 emission in production
process, trough the reduction of noise and dust emission on construction
site, to the possibility of easy demolition and re-use parts of its
components.
The development of concrete precast construction in next years will be
probably related with:
- actions aimed at improving quality, where ``quality{\{}''{\}} means not only
materials and production quality but also as a comfort of the building
usage during its sustainability;
- development and implementation of almost zero energy building,
progress in the range of acoustics or vibrations protection;
- implementation of BIM technology faciliting the cooperation between
investor, designers of all branches, precast elements suppliers and
general performer and others;
- resignation of rigid dimensional modules and limitation of
typification system mainly to solutions of joints or boundary
dimensions;
- the usage of differentiated types of facade layers;
- limitation of the quantity or elimination of visible joints of precast
elements;
- introduction of more and more higher spans of floors;
- construction of higher and higher buildings the highest large-panel
building in Europe, ``Strijkijzer{\{}''{\}} built in Hague in 2007, has 42
floors with total height of 132 m.
Undoubtedly, from all construction fields, the prefabrication area is
one of the most open to the creation and implementation of innovative
solutions, both in the range of materials and accessories, which are
used, and also in the improvement of production equipment, as well as in
the new concepts concerning design and buildings construction. In
developed countries, this fact is related with wide-scale collaboration
of science centres with manufacturers of technology and materials on the
one hand, and on the other hand-with investors, designers and building
contractors. I am convinced, that the development of prefabrication on
the Polish market, consisting in creating own, innovative solutions, and
not only the implementation of foreign solutions, requires just such a
lasting cooperation.},

Considering the urban environmental factors that may contribute to
biased results of energy simulation, the technical issues during the
conversion of data from BIM model to energy simulation software are
investigated. Thermal zones and user behaviors are also examined as
technical and subjective assumptions could lead the simulation to a
wrong direction. The examined challenges and developed strategies will
help achieve building energy simulation and carbon emission estimation

implement the aforementioned energy saving tips. With the use of TARTS,
the temporal relationships between power sockets and appliances can be
accurately described along with timestamped power consumption data.

of the targeted credit points under a specific green rating system are

advancements in green building design and performance analysis. However,
Green building design process is still lack of tools and workflows that
can provide real-time feedback of building sustainability and rating
during the design stage. In this paper, a new workflow of green building
design assessment and rating is proposed based on the integration of
Visual Programing Language (VPL) and BIM. Thus, the aim of this study is
to develop a BIM-VPL based tool for building envelope design and

building Envelope Thermal Transfer Value (ETTV) which is an Energy
Efficiency (EE) prerequisite requirement (up to 15 credits) in both
Green Mark and GreenRE rating systems. The development of the tool
begins first by creating a generic integration framework between BIM-VPL
functionalities and ETTV requirements. Then, data is extracted from the
BIM 3D model and managed using Revit, Excel and Dynamo for visual
scripting. A sample project consisting of a hypothetical residential
building is run and its envelope ETTV performance and rating score are
obtained for the validation of the tool. This tool will support project
team in building envelope design and assessment by allowing them to
select the most appropriate facade configuration according to its

abstract = {By means of ``going greener{\{}''{\}}, ``getting smarter{\{}''{\}} and ``converging
smart-green{\{}''{\}}, an innovation-driven smart city could address the steps
toward more sustainability and aim toward improved human well-being. A
vertical greening means a vertical triumph of greenery in a high density
urban area, in some ways it displays the level of smartness and
greenness in a city. Researchers have suggested the use of vertical
greening in urban areas to improve sustainability of the environment.
However, conventional vertical greening is in open fields, unprotected,
threatened by climate disasters, lacking in better controlled climate
conditions and plant response-based circumstances. In addition are
always the challenges of energy saving, reduction of CO2 emissions,
reduction in water use and in pesticide use. A greenhouse system could
instead solve different facets of these problems in conventional
vertical greening to achieve an optimal balance between an efficient
environmental control and efficient plant use of available resources.
The greenhouse solution appears to be intellectually justifiable,
adaptable and innovative, and appears beneficial to a smart-green and
sustainable smart city. Through the literature review and foresighted
design point of view, the paper first summarizes the major concepts and
trends of smart cities, vertical greening usage and new greenhouse
technologies, and approaches an introduction to the relationship and
development between vertical greening and greenhouse systems, and is
followed by a presentation of a proposed novel prototype of a
green-energy, water-autonomous greenhouse system. The sophisticated and
multidisciplinary greenhouse system reveals its innovations and
advantages by using water resources and solar energy in a rational way,
fit for an alternativetechnology approach towards sustainable
smart-green vertical greening in smart cities. Aimed at improving
responsiveness, efficiency and performance for environmental and
resource sustainability, and also aimed at improving well-being, the
system is expected to be a foresight with simplicity in evolutionary
vertical greening. By means of Industry Foundation Classes file format,
with a true BIM model consisting of a digital prototype of the physical
elements, further design of the system will allow us to simulate an
ideal greenhouse type of vertical greening and understand its behavior
in both the computer environment and actual on-site construction, as
well as allow the building of a smart-green point cloud with BIM
workflow on any network in a smart city.},

abstract = {Recently Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) has emerged in the
Architecture-Engineering-Construction (AEC) industry to assist designers
in making the design process more efficient, by achieving more design
alternatives in less time. Currently, MDO is developed with software
tools that work together and automatically. However, the technical
requisites to develop MDO using Process Integration and Design
Optimization (PIDO) platforms are not clearly specified in the design
optimization literature. There are many difficulties not covered by the
literature: especially the tools' behavior, and the strategies to deal
with PIDO. To determine the technical requirements, the tools' behavior,
the challenges of interoperability and viable strategies, we reviewed
the literature and tested five tools. This paper presents the main
behavior of the tools we studied, and explains the challenges and
strategies to develop MDO through PIDO. We observed three technical tool
requisites: component interoperability, tool automation, and model
parameterization capabilities. We detected low openness levels of the
tool interfaces that did not always enable a full integration with PIDO
or permit access to model properties. The scarcity of commands and the
presence of pop-up menus impeded performing analyses automatically.
Moreover, most of the tools did not allow parametric associations among
components, compatibility among themselves or the addition of custom
components. The strategies proposed focused on testing the tool
interfaces, to validate that each computational process runs
automatically, and to confirm that parametric relationships and
components are possible: The tools tested were not specifically designed
to include full capability to work with PIDO, therefore, enhancements
would be needed to meet the three requisites: component
interoperability, automation and parameterization. Technological,
documentation and programming challenges also emerged when working with
tools. We demonstrated that only certain tools can be used with a PIDO
platform. However, there may be still other requisites for MDO using
different methods that can become the focus of future work. (C) 2016

abstract = {As the sustainability of building projects has become of great concern
for construction professionals, a number of different green building
rating systems have been developed to help ensure that building projects
are designed and built using strategies intended to minimize or
eliminate their impacts on the environment. In the United States,
although the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) green
building rating system has been widely accepted as the national standard
for sustainable building design, its assessment of green buildings is
challenging and time-consuming owing to its complicated process. Such a
green building rating process could be accelerated and facilitated by
using computer technology such as building information modeling (BIM),
an innovative, new approach to building design, engineering, and
construction management that has been widely used in the architecture,
engineering, and construction industry. To enable the green building
rating for a building design in BIM applications, building information
must be represented in such a way that the knowledge contained in LEED
green building criteria can be extracted from the BIM model to support
the assessment. In this paper, a building knowledge framework
representing the LEED green building criteria will be presented. The
proposed framework was implemented into a BIM platform to obtain an
automated tool for the rating of a green building design. The
development of the automated green building rating system and the
results of its implementation will be discussed. (C) 2015 American

abstract = {We report on an investigation of optical and structural properties of
as-grown and thermal annealed GaBixAs1-x (x = 0.012, 0.018 and 0.03)
epilayers by photomodulated reflectance (PR) spectroscopy, atomic force
microscopy (AFM) and micro-Raman spectroscopy. PR spectra are analyzed
by third derivative functional form (TDFF) lineshape. Optical transition
energies are calculated using strain-included valence band anticrossing
(VBAC) model. According to the results, optical transitions are from
conduction bandedge to heavy hole bandedge and to light hole bandedge,
which are affected by compressive strain and effect of strain is clearly
seen when Bi concentration exceeds 2{\%}. We also determine the
band-anticrossing interaction parameter C-BiM as 1.33 eV. TDFF analysis
of as-grown and thermal annealed samples reveal that thermal annealing
causes an unexpectedly large redshift of -22 meV/Bi{\%} in the bandgap
that corresponds to the increase of Bi composition by -25{\%} in the GaAs
lattice. The origin of this redshift is analyzed by AFM and Raman
spectroscopy. Surface morphology of the GaBiAs samples show that
droplets appear on the GaBiAs surface and their sizes increase with
increasing Bi concentration, but tend to decrease following thermal
annealing process and some surface droplets leave pits in their
locations. Raman spectroscopy and AFM results give hints of diffusion of
some Bi atoms from surface into the epilayer that causes an increase in
Bi concentration of the alloy. This increase explains the observed
annealing-induced redshift of the bandgap in PR measurement. (C) 2016

exploit the sustainability value of Building Information
Modelling/models in delivering buildings that require less energy for

achieved by a critical and extensive review of the literature covering:
(1) building energy consumption, (2) building energy performance and
analysis, and (3) building information modeling and energy assessment.
The literature cited in this paper showed that linking an energy
analysis tool with a BIM model helped project design teams to predict
and create optimized energy consumption. To validate this finding, an
in-depth analysis was carried out on a completed BIM integrated
construction project using the Arboleda Project in the Dominican
Republic. The findings showed that the BIM-based energy analysis helped
the design team achieve the world's first 103{\%} positive energy
building. From the research findings, the paper concludes that linking
an energy analysis tool with a BIM model helps to expedite the energy
analysis process, provide more detailed and accurate results as well as
deliver energy-efficient buildings. The study further recommends that
the adoption of a level 2 BIM and the integration of BIM in energy

The complexity of the real world is now represented in its digital
counterpart. The established object-based file format ``Industrial
Foundation Classes (IFC){\{}''{\}} developed by the International Alliance for
Interoperability facilitates interoperability in the context of Building
Information Modeling. Unfortunately, there is no feasible workflow for
filtering energy-related information, e.g. a streamlined version of the
building geometry. Simplification methods often fail on CAD data that is
ignorant of domain specific semantic information (i.e. functional
differences between a door and stucco are not reflected in the geometry
and are therefore often ignored). With EU law now requiring energy
performance certificates to be issued for all buildings, energy
performance analysis becomes an increasingly important topic. Accurate,
yet efficient calculation depends on simple building models. However,
typical IFC models contain a lot of irrelevant data, in particular
geometric representations, which are too detailed for energy performance
analysis. Therefore, we propose an algorithm that extracts input models
suitable for calculations directly from IFC models in a semi-automatic
process. The key aspect of the algorithm is geometry simplification
subject to semantic and functional groups; more specifically, the 3D
representations of walls, slabs, windows, doors, etc. are reduced to a
collection of surfaces describing the building's thermal shell on one
hand, and the material layers associated with it on the other hand. This
simplification takes into account semantic constraints and expert

way in which buildings are being designed. Building professionals are
increasingly expected to improve energy performance of their design. To
achieve a high level of energy performance, multidisciplinary
simulation-based optimization can be utilized to help designers in
exploring more design alternatives and making informed decisions.
Because of the high complexity in setting up a building model for
multi-objective design optimization, there is a great demand of
utilizing and integrating the advanced modeling and simulation
technologies, including BIM, parametric modeling, cloud-based
simulation, and optimization algorithms, as well as a new user interface
that facilitates the setup of building parameters (decision variables)
and performance fitness functions (design objectives) for automatically
generating, evaluating, and optimizing multiple design options. This
paper presents an integrated framework for building information modeling
(BIM)-based performance optimization, BPOpt. This framework enables
designers to explore design alternatives using an open-source, visual
programming user interface on the top of a widely used BIM platform, to
generate models of building design options, assess the environmental
performance of the models through cloud-based simulation, and search for
the most appropriate design alternatives. This paper details the process
of the development of BPOpt and also provides a case study to show its
application. The case study demonstrates the use of BPOpt in minimizing
the energy consumption while maximizing the appropriate daylighting
level for a residential building. Finally, strengths, limitations,
current adoption by academia and industry, and future improvements of
BPOpt for high-performance building design are discussed. (C) 2015

The obtained results indicate that the carbon footprint per unit area of PC construction projects is significantly lower than that of other building types. The carbon footprint of the production phase accounts for more than 90{\%} of the total, and the carbon footprint per unit area of the transportation phase and the construction and installation phase are equivalent. The carbon emission of a building material on its degree of influence is ranked as cement, steel, concrete and wire.

abstract = {High spatial resolution is critical for a building stock energy model to identify spatial hotspots and provide targeted recommendations for reducing regional energy consumption. However, input uncertainties due to lacking high-resolution spatial data (e.g. building information and occupant behavior) can cause great discrepancies between modeled and actual energy consumption. We present a modeling framework that can act as a blueprint model for most European countries based on geo- referenced data, building archetypes, and public algorithms. Further sophistication is added in a step-wise approach, including the shift from average to hourly weather data, refurbishment, and occupants' heating schedules. The model is demonstrated for the city of Leiden, the Netherlands, and the simulated results are spatially validated against the measured natural gas consumption reported at postcode level. Results show that when these factors are considered, the model can provide a good estimate of the energy consumption at the city scale (overestimated by 6{\%}). At postcode level, nearly 83{\%} of the absolute differences between modeled and measured natural gas consumption are within one standard deviation (±25 kWh/m2a, about 30{\%} of the mean measured natural gas consumption). Further research and data would be required to provide reliable results at the level of individual buildings, e.g. information on refurbishment and occupant behavior. The model is well suited to identify spatial hotspots of residential energy consumption and could thus provide a practical basis (e.g. maps) for targeted measures to mitigate climate change. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {In the Architecture Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry, Building Information Model (BIM) authoring tools enable the creation of digital representations of buildings. Each tool implements its own building data model, which makes it difficult to achieve the desired interoperability when building data have to be exchanged with other software (e.g., building energy simulation tools). The representation of BIM models through open standards (e.g., IFC) and Semantic Web technologies can facilitate building data transformation in an automated and flexible way. This is achieved by taking advantage of the logical basis of the Resource Description Framework (RDF) data model and queries created in the Semantic Web query languages. The result is a pragmatic mechanism to transform the data from one data domain to another. This article analyses the potential of Semantic Web query languages to facilitate the data transformation of building data through different alternatives. The first contribution is the identification of fourteen data mapping patterns and three cases of data transformation that enable transforming one data model into another, considering the semantic and structural differences between them. The second contribution is the review and comparison of query languages to carry out the transformations through two different alternatives: using SPARQL-Generate and SPARQL Construct queries. And finally, the third contribution is the definition of a metric to assess the complexity of SPARQL queries. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Energy consumption of buildings is at the forefront of the total energy consumption list, and its environmental impact is increasing, thus making construction industry as a key player in energy. A systematic and comprehensive life cycle perspective assessment of building energy is crucial for maintaining project sustainability. Building energy analysis from life cycle perspective has been increasingly favoured by scholars. However, the links and contents of many literatures have not been summarized and lacking systematic literature research. This review-based research used a holistic analysis approach as the framework. Bibliometrics method in the first stage was used to select 255 papers published during 2009–2019 related to life cycle energy of buildings (LCE-B). Scientometric analysis in the second stage was adopted for identifying the journal sources, scholars, regions and articles that have been fruitful and influential in LCE-B research, and keywords analysis was proposed to preliminarily explore the research topics in the domain (e.g. analysis of optimisation). Results showed that BIM and multi-objective optimisation have become research hotspots recently. An in-depth qualitative discussion in the last stage was conducted to achieve three main objectives: (1) summarise mainstream research topics (e.g. calculation and parameter determination of embodied energy); (2) discuss existing research gaps (e.g. the spatial heterogeneity of embodied energy); and (3) identify future research directions. This study provides a comprehensive knowledge framework combined with philosophical theories that links current research fields with future research trends, providing researchers with multi-disciplinary guidance to gain insight into the latest research on LCE-B. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Buildings in hot humid climates are energy intensive to operate. Energy consumption in Saudi Arabia is almost three times higher than the global average, and one of the major contributors to that is the residential sector. Increasing environmental and economic concerns, in the form of Saudi Vision 2030, mean that the existing unsustainable residential building stock has to be energy retrofitted. This study examines the techno-economic feasibility of retrofitting existing homes in Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia. A Building Information Modelling (BIM)-based retrofit framework has been adopted and investigated on two case studies. Eight Energy Efficiency Measures (EEMs) have been implemented including increasing cooling set point temperature, using energy efficient appliances, replacing conventional lights with more efficient lights, applying window shading, improving glazing type, improving air tightness, using more efficient air conditioning system, and adding envelope insulation. A three-level energy retrofit plan is proposed. Results indicate that annual energy consumption in a villa is reduced by 13.79{\%}, 19.27{\%} and 56.9{\%}, and in the apartment building by 22.84{\%}, 28.85{\%} and 58.5{\%} through a level 1, 2 and 3 retrofit respectively. Compound Payback Period (CPP) was computed to assess the economic viability. For the villa, investing in a level 1, 2 and 3 retrofit will pay back in 0.92, 8.37 and 25.15 years respectively, while for the apartment building, the payback period is 0.60, 11.28 and 24.60 years respectively. Thus, energy retrofitting of existing homes has the potential to significantly reduce energy consumption, however, it is economically not viable in the existing scenario. Electricity tariffs need to be further increased and coupled with incentive programs to render deep energy retrofits feasible. Furthermore, the investigated BIM-based approach can be adopted to investigate energy retrofitting in other climate zones of Saudi Arabia and other countries in the region, and eventually be adopted to efficiently effectuate the colossal task of retrofitting the whole existing residential building stocks of these countries. {\textcopyright} 2020},

Lack of such a comprehensive decision-making framework which utilizes BIM, Management Information Systems (MIS), simulation, and automation tools to choose between different construction alternatives have been addressed in the research background. As an example of decision-making objective, optimized smart building's equipment combination for a certain project should be selected in the feasibility study phase. In this research, a comprehensive decision-making framework was developed to choose smart building's equipment based on energy consumption and cost trade-off. Subsequently, smart building alternatives were considered as a decision-making example to choose the best alternative using BIM, MIS and simulation tools. The research contributes to the automating of some parts of the decision-making framework by developing an Application Programming Interface (API). This API helps with making the appropriate automating permutation out of possible options, totalizing the cost of each combination and sorting data in the research database developed for the recommended framework. This framework, database and API can be used similarly for any other decision making objective. Finally, a model representing the average conditions of residential buildings in Tehran was developed to choose the optimized smart building's equipment combination of 31 considered options. This optimized combination which included all possible smart building options except for smart lighting has an investment return of about 7.5 years which is more than that of similar projects in other countries due to Iran's low energy carrier tariff. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

This study aims to investigate the waste capacity of the selected district and its effect on the environment within the current waste management policy via Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology based on the two indicators; global warming potential and energy flow. The district has 82 buildings with 64,971m2 total gross area and 2,000 populations. Accordingly, the district's waste capacity was evaluated within the classification of Municipal Solid Wastes (MSW), liquid wastes, and demolition wastes. The system boundaries of the LCA were set based on the gate-to-grave approach, which includes generated wastes during the lifespan of the buildings, including their end-of-life stage. Consequently, energy recovery potentials from waste processes were investigated and compared with the primary energy demand of the operational energy consumption of the buildings to perceive the amount of energy compensation range. Additionally, buildings' physical conditions, which obtained from their Building Information Models (BIM), energy performances, derived from their energy models and local specifications, obtained from standards were utilized to identify the current conditions and waste management systems. Critically, the outcomes of all those were used as input data for the LCA model. The results showed that there had been energy recovery potentials from MSW's treatments, while liquid wastes and demolishing wastes treatments have consumed energy. Energy recovery potential from MSW has compensated only 5.8{\%} of operational energy annually, which came from recycling processes. Also, all waste management systems release greenhouse gases to the atmosphere that cause global warming. {\textcopyright} 2020 The Authors},

The proposed methodology evaluates the design development process in terms of decisions on building physics and building geometry during the early design stages to maximize human thermal comfort conditions and reduce cooling load requirements. The methodology integrates a detailed three-dimensional (3D) building and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling within a building information modeling (BIM) platform during the design development stage, which is developed and structured to optimize the evaluation process. The operational characteristics of the building in respect of windows and shutters have important effects on natural ventilation, which in turn influences thermal comfort, and cooling load. Thus, the multi-interaction analysis of natural ventilation is considered with operational schemes of enveloping that are integrated into a 3D model of the building, which is further transformed to a CFD model. Then, four scenarios using a manually operated building opening are created using the BIM platform. Thus, multi-interactions are achieved by developing a 3D-building model, that not only include the building's functions and physical specifications but also incorporates the envelope's thermal capacity coupled with openings that have various operational scenarios for natural ventilation. The results show that the correlation between the air temperature and velocity can provide a comfort zone and decrease the cooling load for energy consumption. The numerical results for one scenario 2 show that if the temperature and velocity values are increased together, human sensation as predicted mean vote (PMV) ranges from 0 to 2, which is considered tolerable for summer comfort, whilst the cooling load is reduced by almost 3{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2020 The Authors},

abstract = {Annually, 48{\%} of the global energy is used by buildings in their construction, operation, and maintenance, causing significant damage to the environment due to the resulting greenhouse gas emissions. During their life cycles, buildings use energy in the form of embodied energy (EE) and operating energy (OE). In a conventional building, EE accounts for 10–20{\%} of a building's life cycle energy (LCE), while OE accounts for 80–90{\%}. As a result, the building sector has taken several measures to reduce OE in buildings. These OE reducing measures fail to account for the subsequent increase in EE and might cause an increase in the building's overall LCE. A systematic review of the literature shows limited research that comprehensively evaluates the impact of design measures aimed at OE reduction on EE for different construction assemblies. In this study, we quantify and compare trade-offs on EE demand, caused by OE reduction measures for eight different building wall assemblies across four climatic zones within the United States. The EE and OE demands of the ASHRAE 90.1–2016 benchmark model and its variations were computed using Tally™ and Autodesk{\textregistered} Green Building Studio{\textregistered} (GBS), respectively. The results helped us determine the EE factor (EE spent per unit of OE savings) for different OE reduction measures. Although the calculated EE factors vary across different climatic zones and construction assemblies, these factors show significant EE costs for different OE reduction measures. This knowledge could help inform the design of evolutionary and deep/machine learning-based algorithms to assess and optimize building energy use. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In the schematic design stage, accounting for the embodied carbon emissions (ECEs) from buildings during design optimization is indispensable for saving energy and reducing emissions from the source. Since the traditional inventory analysis method is more widely applied in the mature construction drawing design stage or with a detailed bill of quantities, developing a method suitable to provide design feedback during the schematic design stage is urgently needed. The key issues of the method that need to be solved are the lack of design information and the difficulty in obtaining quantities. To address the limitations, this paper proposes a BIM-based calculation method that takes the “building element” (BE) as the basic unit, and the accuracy is verified by a frame-structure case study. For this method, it is imperative to create carbon emission factors (CEFs) of the BEs as the basis of calculation combined with the quantities extracted from the model schedules by encoding, which can significantly contribute to the calculation. The results show that this method has good accuracy and high efficiency and can identify potential hotspots of ECEs, which conforms to design process and habits and provides design feedback function for carbon emission reduction (CER). At the schematic design stage, the application of this method can quantitatively evaluate the ECEs and optimize the design from the BE level so that the concept of low carbon design can be truly put into practice and the energy savings and emission reductions of buildings can be controlled as early as possible. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

The products were characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) and Hirshfeld surface analysis, which were accomplished by DFT, PIXEL, QTAIM, and MESP calculations to assess the intermolecular interaction energies and related parameters. In accordance with the pKa rule, hydrogen atom transfer between the proton donor and acceptor molecules used in this study was not observed. In the molecular packing, the cyclic amides are always involved in at least one double-bridged homodimeric hydrogen bonding motif based on N-HOC interactions. In addition, all five crystal structures exhibit heterosynthons with O-HCA/AAOCDHQ/BIM and/or N-HDHQ/BIMOCCA/AA hydrogen bonds and $\pi$-stacking interactions, through which the molecular components are linked in the three-dimensional space. The crystal structures are further stabilized by C-HCl, C-HO and C-H interactions.

abstract = {With the increasing number of nearly zero-energy buildings (NZEB) due to increase of global awareness on climate change, the new concepts of design and control must be developed because of great NZEB dependency on detailing and multidisciplinary approach. This paper proposes a three-level gateway control method for NZEB project delivery by using digital representation of the building in building information modeling (BIM) environment. These controls (C1, C2 and C3) are introduced before three main phases of any project delivery-design phase, construction phase and handover. The proposed project control procedure uses black-box building energy modeling within the BIM environment, so the paper explores the reliability of one tool for direct energy modeling within the BIM-authoring software. The paper shows two types of validation tests with satisfactory results. This leads to conclusion that analyzed tool for energy simulation within BIM environment can be used in a way that is described in a proposed project control procedure. For further research it is proposed to explore reliability of tools for energy simulation connected to other BIM-authoring software, so this project control procedure could be independent of BIM-authoring software used in the paper. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the authors.},

abstract = {There is a significant share of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions attributed to the built environment, either for production or the operation of buildings. Various initiatives are being implemented to reduce the release of GHGs into the atmosphere relying on the evaluation, tracking, recording and verification of GHG emissions and removals. The annual accounting of GHG flows associated with buildings should be conducted in a lifecycle context to ensure that policies are effective at mitigating climate change. Buildings operate for decades and both the climate and electricity grid mix are expected to change significantly during such a time frame. This study aims to support the design of resource- as well as energy-efficient buildings using a sound life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology in the preliminary design stage. A straightforward method that can be applied for a detailed understanding of the effects of climate change and prospective electricity grid mix on building energy use is presented. The novelty of this study was to integrate long-term energy projections in a high temporal resolution LCA for buildings and taking into account different future climates and prospective electricity mixes across Canada. The research integrated the dynamic LCA capabilities directly into a Building Information Model (BIM). Such dynamic considerations as climate and energy mix improves the environmental importance and scientific robustness of LCA metrics. The proposed methodology will assist users to apply a clear framework that helps to define an optimized design alternative through a dynamic energy analysis and future weather forecasting simulation. An example of an actual office building is provided to demonstrate the capabilities and usefulness of the developed integrated framework. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {In the context of the increasingly severe energy crisis and global warming, green buildings and their energy-saving issues are being paid more attention in the world. Since envelope optimization can significantly reduce the energy consumption of green buildings, value engineering (VE) technology and building information modeling (BIM) technology are used to optimize the envelope of green buildings, which takes into account both energy saving and life cycle cost. The theoretical framework of optimization for green building envelope based on BIM-VE is proposed, including a BIM model for architecture, a life cycle cost analysis model, energy-saving analysis model, and a value analysis model. In the life-cycle cost model, a mathematical formula for the life-cycle cost is established, and BIM technology is used to generate a bill of quantity. In the energy-saving analysis model, a mathematical formula for energy saving is established, and BIM technology is used for the building energy simulation. In the scheme decision-making sub-model, VE technology integrating life cycle cost with energy saving is used to assess the envelope schemes and select the optimal one. A prefabricated project case is used to simulate and test the established methodology. The important results show that the 16 envelope schemes make the 16 corresponding designed buildings meet the green building evaluation standards, and the optimal envelope scheme is the "energy-saving and anti-theft door + exterior window 2+ floor 1+ exterior wall 1 + inner shear wall + inner partition wall 2 + planted roof" with the value 10.80 × 10-2 MW{\textperiodcentered}h/ten thousand yuan. A significant finding is that the value generally rises with the increase of energy-saving rate while the life cycle cost is irregular with the increase of energy-saving rate. Compared with previous efforts in the literature, this study introduces VE technology into architectural design to further expand the current boundary of building energy-saving theory. The findings and suggestions will provide a valuable reference and guidance for the architectural design industry to optimize the envelope of green buildings from the perspective of both energy saving and life cycle cost. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the authors.},

Additionally, the resources consumed and the operational energy requirements of buildings are ‘locked-in', potentially for decades. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has recognised construction as a sector in which significant improvements can, and indeed must, be made. But the industry is often argued to be unique, in its multiplicity of stakeholders, transient organisational structures, avoidance of risk and impact on society. The current Virtual Special Issue (VSI) sought to bring together a collection of papers on progress and potential for improvement in the construction sector, in terms of both sustainability and resilience to the changing climate. A total of 34 papers form the VSI. Insights from social science include the need for more holistic perspectives at multiple levels, from buildings to urban plans, and the centrality of human relationships, through leadership, collaboration and along supply chains. Insights from a technology perspective include BIM applications for green and off-site construction, enhanced estimation of construction waste, and developments in materials. Insights on low-carbon construction include evidence that reducing both costs and emissions in the construction sector is viable. This editorial reviews the VSI papers and makes a number of recommendations including the need to recognize that values and understanding change over time and that leadership and human decision-making are essential factors for transformation. Alongside the progress described on sustainability in multiple areas, the editorial calls for an invigorated research focus on how construction can adapt the built environment to the changing future that is before us all. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {This paper details a manual calibration of a 132 zones, highly monitored 5 434 m2 office building located in France. The calibration is conducted over one year of simulation at a five minute time-step. The model is mostly fed with input files containing measured data for each simulation time-step. First simulation results show that the model cannot be considered as being calibrated considering usual guidelines based on statistical indicators calculated on monthly energy consumption. Instead of going through a classical tuning process to match measured and simulated monthly energy consumption data, the choice was made to focus on explaining those discrepancies using available building information and monitoring data. A first dynamical heating and cooling powers analysis has been made, resulting in good correlation with measured values and explaining most of the discrepancies previously noticed, followed by a dynamical temperature analysis performed at the zone scale, and completed by a global statistical analysis at the building scale for the 132 zones of the building. Results showed very good agreement between measured and simulated temperature values with 90{\%} of data points ranging between −1.72 °C and 2.02 °C of error. This demonstrate that a model that at first glance does not perform well considering particular statistical indicators can show an accurate dynamical behavior and a good performance when other variables and performance criteria are considered. This is followed by a discussion of the possible model improvements along with the limitations of statistical analysis compared to dynamic physical analysis for calibration performance assessment. The paper concludes with several proposals to improve the guidelines for calibration procedures involving the use of detailed monitoring data. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

The objective of this study is providing the results of thermal performance simulation results into building information modeling (BIM) models, displaying a series of thermal performance results, and enabling stakeholders to use the BIM tool as a common user interface in the early design stage. This method utilizes a combination of object-oriented physical modeling (OOPM) and BIM. To implement the suggested method, a specific BIM authoring tool called the application programming interface (API) was adopted, as well as an external database to maintain the thermal energy performance results from the OOPM tool. Based on this method, this study created a prototype called the thermal energy performance visualization (TEPV). The TEPV translates the information from the external database to the thermal energy performance indicator (TEPI) parameter in the BIM tool. In the TEPI, whenever BIM models are generated for building design, the thermal energy performance results are visualized by color-coding the building components in the BIM models. Visualization of thermal energy performance results enables non-engineers such as architects to explicitly inspect the simulation results. Moreover, the TEPV facilitates architects using BIM as an interface in building design to visualize building thermal energy performance, enhancing their design production at the early design stages. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the authors.},

abstract = {The feasibility of electricity production via solar energy in the Middle East is high due to the enormous value of solar radiation. Building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) are systems used to utilise the unused spaces that can be installed on the fa{\c{c}}ade or roof by replacing the building's main element. However, the main problem associated with electricity production by BIPV is partial shading on the roof, which can produce multiple hot spots and disturbances to the system if the insolation values within the whole BIPV array vary. Partial shading, in this case, is observed due to the complexly shaped roof. This paper studies the partial shading effect on one of Qatar's most recent projects (metro stations), and models the Education City station, which is a major station. The rooftop is complex, and it has many wavy shapes that can affect the BIPV system's performance. The station is modelled using building-information modelling (BIM) software, wherein all of the station's models are gathered and linked using BIM software to illustrate the BIPV and indicate the solar insolation distribution on the rooftop by simulating the station's rooftop. The system is optimised for maximum yield to determine the optimal configuration and number of modules for each string using a genetic algorithm. The outcomes from the algorithm are based on clustering the solar insolation values and then applying a genetic algorithm optimisation to indicate the optimum BIPV array layout for maximum yield. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the authors.

abstract = {The window-to-wall ratio (WWR), or the proportion of glazing in a building's envelope, influences many design and performance aspects of a building across its life cycle, including aesthetics, material use, daylighting, HVAC size and operating energy consumption, view, and human satisfaction. Prior work argued for reducing WWR to reduce operating energy consumption. The objective of this study is to comprehensively assess the environmental, economic, and social effects of various WWR levels using a triple-bottom line approach. A building information model of the US DOE's large office (12 story) prototype building was developed using Autodesk Revit{\textregistered}. The Tally{\textregistered} Revit application and DOE's EnergyPlus™ were used to perform life cycle assessment (LCA) and assess implications on HVAC equipment sizing, embodied energy of materials, and distribution of operational energy. Designs altering WWR from a baseline of 40{\%} were compared in three different climate zones of the United States. Results showed that increasing the WWR in large office buildings leads to increases in environmental impacts, occupant dissatisfaction, and the life cycle cost for the three different climate zones studied. Most reductions in energy use and environmental impacts were approximately 1{\%} from the baseline scenario for the office building under study. The results imply that while reductions in the WWR do result in improvements across the suite of metrics assessed, other design strategies need to be employed either in conjunction with, or separate from, in order to meet target energy consumption and environmental impact reduction goals within this building program, such as Architecture 2030 Challenges. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {An increase in the usage of information and communication technologies (ICT) and the Internet of Things (IoT) in Facility Management (FM) induces a huge data stack. Even though these data bring opportunities such as cost savings, time savings, increase in user comfort, space optimization, energy savings, inventory management, etc., these data sources cannot be managed and manipulated effectively to increase efficiency at the FM stage. In addition to data management issues, FM practices, or developed solutions, need to be supported with the implementation of lean management philosophy to reveal organizational and managerial wastes. In the literature, some researchers performed studies about awareness about building information modeling (BIM)-FM, and FM-related data management problems in terms of lean philosophy. However, the comprehensive solution for effective FM has not been investigated with the application of lean management philosophy yet. Therefore, this study aims to develop an FM framework for healthcare facilities by considering lean management philosophy since more stable workflow, continuous improvement, and creating more value to customers will help to deliver a more acceptable solution for the FM industry. Within this context, the integration of BIM, Building Energy Performance Simulations, and Big Data Analytics are proposed as a solution. In the study, the Design Science Research (DSR) methodology was followed to develop the FM framework. Depending on the DSR methodology, two scenarios were used to investigate the issue in a real healthcare facility and develop the FM framework. The developed framework was evaluated by four experts, and the revisions of the proposed framework were realized. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the authors.},

Therefore, effective design measures need to be taken to ensure efficient usage and management of new structures. The challenging task for designers is to reduce energy demands while maintaining a high-quality indoor environment and low costs of construction and operations. This study proposes a methodological framework that enables decision-makers to resolve conflicts between energy demand and life cycle costs. A case study is analyzed to validate the proposed method, adopting different solutions for walls, roofs, floors, windows, window-to-wall ratios and geographical locations. Models are created on the basis of all the possible combinations between these elements, enriched by their thermal properties and construction/management costs. After the alternative models are defined, energy analyses are carried out for an estimation of consumption. By calculating the total cost of each model as the sum of construction, energy and maintenance costs, a joint analysis is carried out for variable life cycles. The obtained results from the proposed method confirm the importance of a preliminary assessment from both energy and cost points of view, and demonstrate the impact of considering different building life cycles on the choice of design alternatives. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the authors.},

This study aims using BIM technology to improve indoor daylight performance of the building, determine the proper and comfortable artificial lighting of the building and their costs compared with the traditional methods used to calculate lighting, calculate the amount of renewable energy and cost saving that can be obtained from the photovoltaic panels, assess energy performance analysis at design stage and then create design alternatives to increase energy efficiency. The idea of this research was applied in one of the Iraqi projects; the authors found that applying BIM technology helps a lot in increasing energy performance efficiency through many strategies and it also gives the ability to solve all problems related to the performance of energy in the design stage. The results concluded that applying BIM technology improves indoor daylight performance of the building where the artificial lighting reduce around (29 lamps) as well as the cost of lamps reduce around (6500ID), use photovoltaic(PV) panels reduce annual energy consumption around 44{\%} as well as achieves cost-saving about (22,601 {\$}/year), total electricity consumption equal to (421,645 kw h/year) and total fuel consumption equal to (565,633 MJ/year).

abstract = {The energy consumption of a constructed facility is a primary concern as a result of its impact on the total energy expenditure. It has been found that up to 70{\%} of the power consumption in Saudi Arabia are caused by building structures and air conditioning (AC). Energy consumption in government-constructed buildings constitutes a considerable ≈13{\%} of the consumption of the total energy in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, the government of Saudi Arabia initiated the Saudi Energy Efficiency Program (SEEP) that goals to lower the domestic energy severity by roughly 30{\%} by 2030. This paper introduces a study carried out in Eastern Province in Saudi Arabia to identify factors influencing the consumption of energy in school facilities (which are built of concrete in hot and humid climate zones), investigate the correlation between those factors and their impacts on the consumption of energy in school facilities, and finally, develop a prediction model for the energy consumption of school facilities. The study was based on the utilization of 352 real-world datasets of energy consumption of operating schools across Eastern Province in Saudi Arabia. The developed energy prediction model considers eleven identified factors that influence the consumption of energy of constructed schools. The identified factors were utilized as input variables to build the model. A systematic search among different neural network (NN) design architectures was conducted to identify the optimal network model. Validation of the developed model on eight real-world cases demonstrated that the accuracy of the developed model was about 87.5{\%}. Moreover, the findings of this study indicate that the weakest correlation between the input variables was recorded as -0.015 between "type of school" and "AC capacity," while the strongest correlation was recorded as 0.95 between the variables of "number of classrooms" and "total air-conditioned area (sqm)," followed by "total air-conditioned area (sqm)" and "number of students," which was recorded as 0.90. It is worth noting that "AC capacity" was the most significant predictor, which increased exponentially for high values of energy consumption, followed by "total school roof area." The study also found that the age of the schools had a very small impact on energy consumption, although the age of the schools varied from 11 to 51 years. This was probably due to a good maintenance system applied by the Ministry of Education. The implication of the developed prediction model was that the model can be used by the Ministry of Education to predict the energy consumption and its associated cost for public school buildings for the purpose of budget allocation. The model may be utilized as a stand-alone application, or it can be integrated with an existing building information module (BIM)-based system. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the author.},

Based on the establishment of the REVIT model, Ecotect is used to simulate the energy consumption. By comparing the energy-saving performance of different schemes, the LEED score is calculated to determine the most cost-effective design.

abstract = {Most applied strategies during the building design process require careful consideration of indoor air quality and thermal conditions. This requires a detailed analysis involving multi and interdisciplinary efforts during the design process and thus, in turn, manifold interactions among various analysis methods and their simulation tools. An undesired consequence of this activity may be major problems in terms of data clashes and data losses. These difficulties may be overcome by utilizing a three-dimensional (3D) building model that not only includes the building's functional and physical specifications but also incorporates its thermal capacity and environmental dynamics. For this, building information modeling (BIM) can be employed as a base. The interoperability of the programs thus utilized need to be identified and ensued, as this is not yet clearly defined in the literature for these complicated analysis methods. This study thus aims to improve the building design process by developing a method to determine the interoperability of the utilized programs for evaluating a building's energy performance and indoor comfort through the BIM approach. A case study is conducted to verify the applicability of the proposed method and to identify the interoperability limits during the data exchange. To this end, three main analysis models are developed and evaluated. The architecture of the building is developed with the 3D building model as specified by the building's physical conditions; the indoor comfort conditions are developed with the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) of natural ventilation as specified by temperature, humidity, and air velocity; and energy performance is developed with a building energy model specified by the building architecture and its systems. These are then all integrated through a BIM platform. Therefore, the complexity of software integration is eliminated by the BIM-based proposed methodology. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

The incorporation of an insulating layer in the extrados of the building envelope is the most effective way of reducing the transmittance of a facade, eliminating thermal bridges, and optimizing its energy consumption. There is no doubt about the effectiveness of this solution in terms of thermal protection. However, this process collides with the preservation of the original composition of buildings with ornate facades. This article presents a protocol for the rehabilitation of ornate facades of historic buildings through the application of an insulating layer on the outside of the walls. The protocol shows that advanced techniques applied with an integrated approach permit compatibility between energy rehabilitation and the preservation of the original value. In addition to applying strategies of a high technological level, the protocol proposes a reflection upon a balanced intervention on ornamental elements, as well as the relationship between the degree of energy improvement of an ornate facade, and the degree of preservation of the original composition. A methodology is established that combines different avant-guard techniques and systems.

Currently, the use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) is growing in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operation (AECO) sector, and it assumes relevance in buildings energy simulation. Therefore, this work aims to explore the potential and limitations of applying BIM to energy management and simulation in the operation life cycle phase of a service building, and comparing it with a specific and customized tool for energy efficiency assessment of public buildings. A service building BIM model was developed in Autodesk Revit showing its utility when used as an asset for storing and organize energy-related data. The add-in Energy Analysis for Autodesk Revit allowed automatically generating the Building Energy Model (BEM) from the BIM model and performing a cloud-based simulation in Autodesk Green Building Studio (GBS). The energy consumption results obtained in GBS were compared with the results obtained with the energy simulation tool ECO.AP developed in the Portuguese National Laboratory of Civil Engineering (LNEC). It was possible to infer that the input limitations of GBS, mainly in HVAC systems customization, compromise the representation and energy performance evaluation of the building under actual operating conditions, making GBS more adequate for early buildings life cycle stages where energy simulation results may support decisions that aim to improve the buildings energy performance during the operation phase. {\textcopyright} 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract = {Buildings account for more than 90{\%} of total electricity consumption in Hong Kong, one third of which comes from the residential sector. High-rise buildings dominate Hong Kong, but energy use in high-rise buildings has been insufficiently examined in previous studies, especially at the household or occupant level. This paper aims to explore the multiple factors that influence energy consumption in high-rise residential buildings, including the impact of occupant behaviours. The research was conducted through a questionnaire and face-to-face interviews with 135 households of a typical forty-floor residential building in Hong Kong. The survey examined technical and physical factors, human-influenced factors and social factors of energy consumption, including building information, social demographics, energy-related occupant behaviour modes and the residents' energy-saving attitudes. The results show that the monthly electricity bills of households at the twentieth floor or lower were 26{\%} higher than those of households at higher floors during spring, summer and autumn, but similar during winter. This difference was attributed to various occupant behaviours, such as operating air-conditioners and opening windows. These findings expand the knowledge of occupant behaviour in high-rise residential buildings and inform building energy conservation policy-making in Hong Kong. {\textcopyright} 2020, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract = {Rapid urbanization has driven economic and social development, but it has also led to continued growth in building energy consumption. It is of great significance to ensure the user comfort while controlling the growth of building energy use. Accurate quantification of urban buildings' energy demand can support energy efficient and sustainable community design, assist urban morphology generation and optimization, building layout optimization, building shape and construction design, HVAC system optimization, assessment of the energy program and policy. In recent years, researchers worldwide have carried out research of urban scale energy consumption calculation methods from different perspectives, and encountered different technical difficulties. This paper provides a critical review on the energy modeling methods at urban neighborhood scale from the following three aspects: database, models and platforms. Through literature review, the authors indicate the advantages and limitations of current urban building energy calculation methods and tools, and propose the following possible approaches to improve the operational energy consumption calculation method for urban buildings: (1) develop micro-environment data generation methods that can be directly applied to energy consumption calculation of urban buildings; (2) improve the capabilities to collect, filter and convert the building information data by introducing the data mining technique; (3) introduce the cluster analysis and artificial intelligence technology to improve the speed of energy consumption calculation; (4) develop a visualization platform to realize real-time editing and calculating of urban design. {\textcopyright} 2020, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract = {In this work, the analysis of the mass transfer phenomena in catalytic open-cell foams is carried out through the combination of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and experiments, using the CO oxidation on Pt(1{\%})/$\gamma$-Al2O3/foam as a model reaction. The influence of the local hydrodynamic effects on the diffusion-reaction phenomena occurring at the gas-solid interface of the open-cell solid foams are investigated by Direct Numerical Simulations assuming an infinitely fast reaction. A correlation for the Sherwood number as function of Reynolds -for low Re- is proposed. To validate this experimentally, aluminum foams coated with Pt(1{\%})/$\gamma$-Al2O3 are tested at different reaction conditions for the CO oxidation. The obtained reaction rates and apparent activation energy show the presence of external mass transfer limitations. An analysis of the diffusion-reaction phenomena taking place in the wash-coated layer is presented in terms of dimensionless numbers. A practical criterion is developed in terms of the Thiele modulus (ϕw) and the Biot number (Bim) for the identification of the reaction regimes: kinetic control (ϕw2/Bim{\textless}0.1), internal and/or external mass transfer limitations (0.1{\textless}ϕw2/Bim{\textless}10), and full mass transfer control (ϕw2/Bim{\textgreater}10). {\textcopyright} 2020 The Authors},

abstract = {Calculating emissions and related environmental impacts for buildings is typically a data-heavy and labour-intensive task. Widely used life cycle assessment (LCA) standards require meticulous modelling of multiple processes for each part within a product or a subassembly. This level of detailing demands time-consuming manual modelling and essentially renders full LCA of entire city blocks unrealistic. Within this context, this paper investigates how LCA results of modelling processes which involve a range of automated input data sources compare to those resulting from a highly detailed base case model. Findings show that models generated from data gathered from Google Street View and the U.S. Census produce the closest results to the base case model, with the lowest deviations occurring in embodied energy (0.06−6.0{\%}) and global warming potential (0.7−4.8{\%}) results. These findings imply that data with lower granularity can lead to precise LCA results, depending on the inventory and impact categories considered. {\textcopyright} 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\&} Francis Group.},

This study is helpful for architects or urban administrators to understand how traditional vernacular buildings contribute to energy saving. After field surveying and mapping of these traditional buildings, this study found that the materials and the constructions of traditional buildings as well as the pattern and the layout are different from current buildings, which might lead to the high effective energy saving of traditional houses. This type of architecture can effectively improve the living environment through adjusting temperature, and improve illumination and ventilation according to the conducted testing. Also, the thermal and heat environments of traditional vernacular buildings are analyzed using BIM software. The results of the analysis demonstrate that these type of buildings can maintain great thermal and heat environment by similar building structures and materials, which also could meet the current standards in Hubei.

abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) is creating new opportunities for the Architecture, Engineering and Construction industry. One of them is the integration of the Building Sustainability Assessment (BSA) during the design process. Currently, an approach for using BIM to foster and optimise the application of BSA methods has not been clearly established yet, creating a knowledge gap on the application of BIM for sustainability assessment purposes. Thus, this paper analyses the current role of BIM to evaluate three BSA methods-LEED, BREEAM and SBTool. The current BIM applicability is assessed by performing a systematic review, where the criteria being assessed and the applied BIM software are identified. A comparison is made to determine which BSA method can currently take more advantage from BIM and to identify the number of assessed criteria from each one. Furthermore, the attractiveness of a BIM-based assessment for SBTool is analysed, facing the actual BIM scenario for LEED and BREEAM. Despite the restrictions, BIM use is increasing for sustainability purposes. Most of the analysed studies and identified software are still focused on the use of LEED for assessing sustainability during the design phase. However, BIM software capabilities can also support the assessment of the other BSA methods so that process replicability can happen. Among the most addressed criteria, the energy and material-related categories are the most eminent. Autodesk Revit is the most-used software. A BIM-based assessment for SBTool will have enough attractiveness. It can assess, at least, the same percentage of criteria as the other schemes, creating new opportunities to enhance building sustainability. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the authors.},

In this paper, the building information and energy consumption data of 29 coach stations in five climate regions of China were obtained by field investigations. The annual total comprehensive building energy consumption was 31.37-128.08 kWh/(m2{\textperiodcentered}a). The annual total CO2 emissions from building operation in the coach stations was 17.01-134.77 kgCO2/(m2{\textperiodcentered}a). The heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system was the largest energy using and CO2 emissions sector: 30.42-72.47{\%} of the energy consumption and 30.42-83.93{\%} of the CO2 emissions were generated by HVAC system. The energy consumption and CO2 emission level of coach stations and that of other kinds of public buildings were compared. Results showed that the energy consumption and CO2 emission levels of coach stations investigated were relatively low, mainly because the passenger thermal comfort was scarified. Based on the investigation data, energy consumption analysis models of coach stations in five regions were established by simulation when the passenger thermal comfort was met. The potentials of energy saving and CO2 emission reduction were studied from forms of the HVAC system, heat recovery and natural illumination. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the authors.},

X-ray analysis reveals that the bimetallic Cd(II) subunits in complex 1 are bridged by PBIX to form a 0D structure with 26-membered metallomacrocycle. In complexes 2, 3 and 4, the metal centers are linked by OBIX or BIM molecules to generate 1D chains. In complex 5, the Cd(II) ions are bridged by NBI ligands to form a 2D network, which is further extended to a 3D framework through $\pi$–$\pi$ stacking interaction.

abstract = {Purpose: The operational phase of a building's lifecycle is receiving increasing attention, as it consumes an enormous amount of energy and results in tremendous detrimental impacts on the environment. While energy simulation can be applied as a tool to evaluate the energy performance of a building in operation, the emergence of Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology is expected to facilitate the evaluation process with predefined and enriched building information. However, such an approach has been confronted by the challenge of interoperability issues among the related application software, including the BIM tools and energy simulation tools, and the results of simulation have been seldom verified due to the unavailability of corresponding experimental data. This study aims to explore the interoperability between the commonly used energy simulation and BIM tools and verifies the simulation approach by undertaking a case study. Design/methodology/approach: With Autodesk Revit and EnergyPlus selected as the commonly used BIM and energy simulation tools, respectively, a valid technical framework of transferring building information between two tools is proposed, and the interoperability issues that occur during the data transfer are studied. The proposed framework is then employed to simulate the energy consumption of a single-family house, and sensitivity analysis and analysis on such parameters as schedule are conducted for building operations to showcase its applicability. Findings: The simulation results are compared with monitored data and the results from another simulation tool, HOT2000; the comparison reveals that EnergyPlus and HOT2000 predict the total energy consumption with a difference from the monitoring data of 8.0 and 7.1{\%}, respectively. Practical implications: This research shows how to efficiently use BIM to support building energy simulation. Relevant stakeholders can learn from this research to avoid data loss during BIM model transformation. Originality/value: This research explores the application of BIM for building energy simulation, compares the simulation results among different tools and validates simulation results using monitored data. {\textcopyright} 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {Purpose: This paper searches for integration methods proposed by different authors that assess the life cycle of a building using models of building information modeling (BIM) and it also compares and discusses them. Design/methodology/approach: Systematic literature review (SLR) is selected as the main research method of the present paper, aiming to collect and critically analyze multiple research studies. This paper is not only limited to studies where the whole life cycle has been assessed but also includes other papers which only integrated BIM to analyze carbon footprint, embodied carbon dioxide (CO2) or energy consumption. Findings: Taking into account the countries that have published articles about the subject, it is possible to deduce that it has been studied in all of the continents, except Africa. In comparison with other continents, Asia and Europe have developed more studies. Furthermore, 76{\%} of the 34 selected articles were published in journals and only 24{\%} in conferences proceedings, and the number of papers that relates life cycle assessment (LCA) methods using BIM has grown from 2013 to 2015, proving that the current theme is relevant. Several aspects of this literature review show the need to develop automated processes for LCA of buildings during the project's development phase. There is already a tendency to compare LCA results for buildings applied to BIM models, contributing to decision-making related to alternate projects, selection of materials, suppliers and components from an environmental perspective. Originality/value: In the current global scenario, it is the notorious negative impact on the environment over the years caused by the architecture, engineering and construction industry (AEC). The integration of BIM–LCA can reduce time and improve the application of environmental analysis. Moreover, the proper application of a LCA method to evaluate the environmental impacts of the project can be hindered due to lack of information in the database about the materials or due to failures in the interoperability between BIM software and the LCA tool. {\textcopyright} 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {In Mainland China, the building industry is one of the highest energy-consuming and most highly polluting sectors. Lean construction is famous for eliminating non-value-added activities and striving to increase value delivery during the construction process, and it is considered to have immense potential to facilitate the effective use of resources. As a result, lean construction has attracted increasing attention in Mainland China. To answer key questions—namely “What are the characteristics, influence factors, and application status of lean construction in Mainland China?” and “What are the contributions of and gaps in lean construction in Mainland China?”—this study used a five-step systematic research method to review the lean construction literature. Content analysis was conducted on four topic clusters: lean construction theory and application, lean construction research areas, lean construction influence factors, and an effect evaluation of lean construction in Mainland China. This study contributes to the body of literature on lean construction knowledge and its practical application, representing the first attempt to enact a systematic review to enable understanding of the achieved targets of lean construction in Mainland China, and it concludes that lean construction is in a stage of rapid development in Mainland China. The evolutionary characteristics of the theory and practical application of lean construction in Mainland China were clarified, and the status of lean construction research areas, including sustainability, building information modeling, supply chain management, construction industrialization, and safety management, was illustrated. In addition, it addresses some issues that have not been reviewed clearly in the past, such as the factors that influence lean construction in Mainland China and the effect of lean construction in Mainland China. Finally, this review proposes a framework that links current research areas to future research directions. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {The change from a centralized to a decentralized energy supply creates new challenges in the planning of such energy supply concepts. Specialized planning tools that can cope with the complex requirements and multi-layered boundary conditions of local energy use are therefore needed. Existing methods need to be further developed and optimized to suit the complex stakeholder structures encountered in innovative district projects, as well as for research purposes. This paper presents selected aspects and challenges in the development of an application-oriented planning tool. Using a North German district as a case study, the usability of a Building Information Model as an aggregated data platform is tested in the context of a residential energy district planning process. In addition, the modeling of heating grids using a combination of Geographic Information System and open source thermodynamic tools is presented. Economic valuation methods are examined to determine the extent to which the value of flexibility and access to local flexibility markets can be taken into account. Finally, an approach for evaluating the ecological aspects of the district energy supply is presented, based on the dynamic assessment of imported and exported energy quantities. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the authors.},

abstract = {The building health has become an increasingly popular topic in recent years, as the health of a building is directly related to the safety and health of the users. A scientific evaluation of building health can help to assess building health issues and to avoid the catastrophic consequences of the building system failure. Although there are some building health evaluation methods for public buildings and residential buildings, there is a lack of approach for assessing the building health of commercial buildings. The study aims to propose an innovative and practical approach to evaluate the building health of commercial buildings by integrating the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), geographic information system (GIS), and building information modelling (BIM). Based on the AHP approach, the building health evaluation model is proposed to consider five aspects, including comfort performance (weight 5.15{\%}), safety performance (weight 51.88{\%}), environmental performance (weight 24.92{\%}), operation management (weight 12.56{\%}), and economic performance (weight 6.49{\%}). It suggests that safety performance should be considered the most important factor in building health evaluation. Besides, a commercial project in Shenzhen, China was selected as a case study to validate the feasibility of the proposed evaluation model. Based on the results, the building health of the study case is scored as 6.9654 out of 10, which is ranked as intermediate. To be specific, the comfort performance scored 0.4515, safety performance scored 3.3344, environmental performance scored 2.2308, operation management scored 0.9019, and the economic performance scored 0.0972. Many recommendations have been made to improve the building health performance of the building, for instance, it recommends to reduce the energy consumption of the building to improve the economic performance of the building and the operation management performance. The developed model can help the governmental department regarding the building sector and asset manager to identify the building's health performance and take further actions. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Rapid urbanization is one of the present characteristics in both developed and developing countries. It is projected that by 2050 around 68 {\%} of the world's population shall live in urban areas. As a result, many city development initiatives are proposed by various research centers or through academia to aid in managing the process. One of the most evolving concepts through the past two decades is Smart Cities. The concept of smart cities has been defined and formulated by many research efforts and organizations. However, most of these definitions and initiatives focus on the operation stage of the city. This paper proposes an inclusive framework for integrating Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Geographical Information System (GIS) to plan and forecast the utility infrastructure needs for expanding and emerging cities to highlight the concept of “smartness” during the planning stage. The considered infrastructure needs are freshwater consumption, sewage capacity and electrical energy requirements. Firstly, the city is broken down into several districts, lands and plots. Afterwards, through the assignment of relevant land use, building type information and various other information, an interactive tool is originated to allow for the formulation of different city development schemes and the representation of their respective resulting infrastructure needs. The framework is targeted to be flexible enough in order to be applied to any city, not just a single case as smart city solutions need to adopt to diverse cities' needs. The proposed framework is advocated to enforce the concept of both smart and sustainable cities by taking a closer look at the city's planning and development stages and infrastructure requirements which shape a sizable part of the city's performance throughout its expansion and development. It can also serve as a decision support tool for better planning and management of smart city infrastructure requirements. Finally, a case study is represented to demonstrate the practical features of the proposed framework. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Heating and cooling consumes most of the energy in buildings. Faults and problems in HVAC systems waste up to 20{\%} of heating and cooling energy. Identifying spaces with HVAC problems within a facility remains a major challenge for facility managers. This study aims to detect spaces with potential problems that causes energy overconsumption, human discomfort, or HVAC work overload. To achieve that, a Building Information Model (BIM)-based framework that combines the output data of building energy simulations, Building Energy Management Systems (BEMS), and Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMS) is proposed. The framework enables BIM components to utilize data collected by the other systems to determine the intended energy performance and compare it with actual energy performance, as well as to provide access to maintenance history and BEMS alarms occurred in the building at element level. The framework was tested using data collected from an educational building over one-month period when the building was unoccupied to prevent users from manipulating the results. Experimental results show that the framework enabled identification of building spaces with abnormal or malfunctioning behavior that was not detected by the BEMS. This study supplements the body of knowledge in facilities energy management by providing a BIM-based framework that utilizes output data of energy simulation, BEMS and CMMS to locate and detect building spaces with potential problems that need maintenance. Furthermore, it enables facility managers to collect and view relevant data from various systems in one central platform; BIM. It also allows them to adjust their maintenance plans based on the poor behavior of specific spaces within their building. {\textcopyright} 2020 The author(s).},

abstract = {Photovoltaic (PV) energy is a promising source of clean energy that can contribute to the development of sustainable cities and the mitigation of global warming. Conventionally, PV modules were only considered for installation on the rooftop of buildings. However, nowadays there are various types of PV modules that can be installed on different surfaces of buildings, such as curtain walls, windows, and balconies. Given that the productivity of the PV system depends heavily on the layout design (i.e., the size, type, location, and orientation of the modules), it is imperative to perform detailed simulation of radiation potential on different surfaces of the buildings to find the most efficient PV layout. Existing simulation methods, which mostly use only the geometric model of buildings, cannot discriminate between different types of building surfaces. As a result, these methods cannot be used to design PV layouts where different types of surface-restricted PV modules (e.g., PV modules that can be installed on windows) are incorporated. Therefore, this research builds on the advent of Building Information Modeling (BIM) to develop a parametric modeling platform for the design of surface-specific PV module layout on the entire skin of buildings using the surface properties of the BIM model. Using this platform, designers will be able to (1) perform radiation simulation on a combination of desired surfaces of buildings, (2) study the impact of various design characteristics (e.g., size and orientation), (3) develop complex scenarios for the layout of PV modules on the buildings, and (4) perform detailed cost-benefit analysis of each scenario. A prototype is developed using Dynamo visual programming platform to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method. A case study is presented for a tall building in Montreal, Canada. Various scenarios are developed and systematically compared from energy and cost perspectives. The case study demonstrated the potentials of the developed platform for the development and in-depth analysis of complex scenarios for the layout of PV modules on building skin. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by demonstrating how BIM can be leveraged towards a more sustainable design of buildings through facilitating the design of complex PV layouts on building skin. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In the European framework, there is a strong drive to develop integrated approaches aimed at understanding and improving the energy behavior of public historic buildings within urban contexts. However, the examples already provided tend to address the issue from mono-disciplinary perspectives, losing the opportunity for a coordinated view. The research suggests a methodology to reach the definition of a three-dimensional database, which incorporates spatial models and energy information, with the final goal of merging heterogeneous information that is useful to interpret the overall framework and to design sustainable development scenarios. The platform achieves GIS (Geographic Information System) and BIM (Building Information Modeling) integration by using the CityGML data model, for supporting multi-scale analyses without break of continuity, ranging from urban to building level. The discussion combines the applicative case with the theoretical background, deepening the role of a solid knowledge framework as a basis for sustainable interventions on public historic buildings. To better explain and test the methodology, a case study on the University built heritage of Pavia is presented and three possible outputs deriving from the database are discussed. The example demonstrates the strength of the approach, which is able to provide a variety of results coming from a unique source of information, ensuring coherence and unambiguousness at all levels of investigation. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the authors.},

abstract = {Building energy consumption accounts for 36{\%} of the overall energy end use worldwide and is growing rapidly as developing countries continue to urbanize. Understanding the energy use at urban scale will lay the foundation for identification of energy efficiency opportunities to be deployed at speed. China has almost half of global new constructions and plays an important role in building suitability. However, an open source national building energy consumption database is not available in China. To provide data support for building energy consumptions, this paper used a simulation method to develop an urban building energy consumption database for a pilot city in Wuhan, China. First, residential, small, and large office building archetype energy models were created in EnergyPlus to represent typical building energy consumption inWuhan. The baseline reference model simulation results were further validated using survey data from the literature. Second, stochastic simulations were conducted to consider different design parameters and occupants' energy usage intensity scenarios, such as thermal properties of the building envelope, lighting power density, equipment power density, HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) schedule, etc. A building energy consumption database was generated for typical building archetypes. Third, data-driven regression analysis was conducted to support quick building energy consumption prediction using key highlevel building information inputs. Finally, a web-based urban energy platform and an interface were developed to support further third-party application development. The research is expected to provide fast energy efficiency building design solutions for urban planning, new constructions as well as building retrofits. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the authors.},

abstract = {The thermal comfort retrofitting of existing transport stations is an opportunity to increase the interest in the use of public transportation while improving the performance of the building, and consequently reduce the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The aim of this study is to implement an innovative methodology to evaluate and improve the thermal comfort of an existing semi-outdoor bus station in the winter season through the application of retrofit solutions. Some research was recently published concerning the evaluation of the thermal environment in semi-outdoor spaces showing that thermal comfort is achievable. The thermal environment of the station was evaluated through an experimental campaign involving the measurement of physical parameters and the application of questionnaires to the passengers. The results of the questionnaires indicate a colder sensation in the morning period and a lower percentage of dissatisfied people when compared to the application of the thermal comfort models. However, the preference of the passengers for a warmer environment was also identified. A realistic thermal comfort target, adapted to this semi-outdoor space, could, therefore, be defined. An innovative integrated methodology articulated in a BIM2BEM approach was applied in this work. The methodology included the joint application of Building Information Modeling and Building Energy Modeling, allowing the simulation of different retrofitting alternatives. The decision-making process was completed with an economic analysis of the alternatives, using the Savings-to-Investment Ratio (SIR) as an indicator. In order to improve the passengers' thermal comfort, the option to create an enclosed heated waiting area was technically supported by the results of the study. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {The development of new climate change policies has increased the motivation to reduce energy use in buildings, as reflected by a stringent regulatory landscape. The construction industry is expected to adopt new methods and strategies to address such requirements, focusing primarily on reducing energy demand, improving process efficiency and reducing carbon emissions. However, the realisation of these emerging requirements has been constrained by the highly fragmented nature of the industry, which is often portrayed as involving a culture of adversarial relationships and risk avoidance, which is exacerbated by a linear workflow. Recurring problems include low process efficiency, delays and construction waste. Building information modelling (BIM) provides a unique opportunity to enhance building energy efficiency (EE) and to open new pathways towards a more digitalised industry and society. BIM has the potential to reduce (a) waste and carbon emissions, (b) the endemic performance gap, (c) in-use energy and (d) the total lifecycle impact. BIM also targets to improve the whole supply chain related to the design, construction as well as the management and use of the facility. However, the construction workforce is required to upgrade their skills and competencies to satisfy new requirements for delivering BIM for EE. Currently, there is a real gap between the industry expectations for employees and current training and educational programmes. There is also a set of new requirements and expectations that the construction industry needs to identify and address in order to deliver more informed BIM for EE practices. This paper provides an in-depth analysis and gap identification pertaining to the skills and competencies involved in BIM training for EE. Consultations and interviews have been used as a method to collect requirements, and a portfolio of use cases have been created and analysed to better understand existing BIM practices and to determine current limitations and gaps in BIM training. The results show that BIM can contribute to the digitalisation of the construction industry in Europe with adapted BIM training and educational programmes to deliver more informed and adapted energy strategies. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the authors.},

abstract = {This study discusses a numerical study that was developed to optimize the ventilation system in a power substation prior to its installation. We established a multiobjective particle swarm optimizer to identify the best approach for simultaneously improving, first, the ventilation performance considering the most appropriate inlet size and outlet openings and second, the reduction of the synthetic noise of the ventilation and power consumption from the exhaust fan equipment and its operation. The study used building information modeling to construct indoor and outdoor models of the substation building and verified the overall performance using ANSYS FLUENT 18.0 software to simulate the air velocity and air temperature distribution within the building. Results show that the exhaust fan of the B1F cable finishing room and the 23 kV gas insulated switchgear (GIS) room optimize the reduction of horsepower by approximately 1 Hp and 0.5 Hp. The combined noise is reduced by 4 dBA and 2 dBA; the exhaust fan runs for 30 min, and the two equipment rooms can cool down by 2.9 °C and 1.7 °C, respectively. Therefore, it is confirmed that the MOPSO algorithm provides a more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly building ventilation environment. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the authors.},

abstract = {The construction sector is one of the most polluting industries, generating between 30{\%} and 40{\%} of the worldwide environmental burden in terms of raw materials, direct and indirect energy consumption, waste, and CO2 emissions. Recent advances in computer science and data management have facilitated the evaluation of present and future impacts, thus improving the sustainability of architectural designs. Powerful software tools, such as Building Information Modelling (BIM), allow environmental indicators to be incorporated into the construction elements that make up the project to evaluate it during the design stage. In this work, the state of the art of ecological indicator application through BIM platforms is studied. Barriers and uncertainties are also identified. Subsequently, a model is proposed to evaluate the environmental impact of an urbanization process or a project through several ecological indicators (carbon footprint, water footprint, and embodied energy). To perform this analysis, the most important aspect is to determine the quantities of each construction element and their clear decomposition into subelements, since both aspects add certainty to the analysis. For this purpose, construction cost databases are a good instrument for introducing environmental awareness. The reliability of LCA data, which can be obtained from generic databases or ecolabels such as environmental product declarations, becomes crucial. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the authors.},

abstract = {One of the primary objectives in the refurbishment of buildings is to identify the best combination of Energy Conservation Measures (ECMs) in terms of energy efficiency. The current Building Energy Performance (BEP) simulation tools require a great deal of time and effort because data from multiple sources must be properly combined (e.g., building/urban models, ECM catalogues, weather condition files) in order to create energy simulation models. In addition, the process of manually setting up each scenario in order to obtain the most optimal solution is also a demanding and time-consuming task. The growing presence of the Building Information Model/Modelling (BIM) technologies in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry, combined with the new capabilities to link and integrate data using Semantic Web technologies, is presented as an alternative to automate the simulation process. In this article, we present a system that takes advantage of the capabilities of these technologies to integrate ECM data into BEP simulation models in an automated way. The system is composed of a catalogue of ECM measures described in Resource Description Framework (RDF) and a software component that facilitates their application in the models. The system has been developed in the context of OptEEmAL, a research project aimed at creating a web platform to facilitate building simulations at a district scale. The applicability of the system is demonstrated in a case study of a district-scale project. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {The selection of cost-effective components of the building envelope plays a significant role in a sustainable building design solution. Therefore, in terms of effective decision-making, it is important to have a complete insight into construction and running costs throughout the lifespan of the building. A systematic building information modelling (BIM) approach as a new trend in the innovative approaches in the construction (AECO) industry provides appropriate support for improvement of environmental assessments. Our study presents a new approach to automated/semi-automated comprehensive energy and the whole life-cycle cost analysis of building envelope components using BIM, and, as such, it represents a novelty for Advanced Construction Project Management. It focuses on the sequence of steps required for evaluation of energy and economic assessment, from the basic 3D BIM model, through the energy and cost analysis, to the final evaluation and decision-making. The energy balance was calculated with dynamic simulation, the results of which formed the basis for the cost analysis. Economic assessment of construction and operating costs was performed by implementation of the cost-optimal methodology. Our proposed approach contributes to the environmental assessment of building envelope components throughout the life cycle and includes the economic valuation. The applicability of the systematic approach in our case study considered 24 different variants of building envelope components at three different U-values, namely U0 = 0.28W/m2K for external wall, U0 = 0.20W/m2K for roof, U1 = 0.15W/m2K and U2 = 0.10W/m2K. Sophisticated project BIM management software was used for the economic evaluation of all elements of the life-cycle costs (LCC). In summary, the main contribution of this approach is provision of a comprehensive and simple insight into all costs in a transparent way, because a 5D BIM model allows for optimal decision-making on appropriate energy and cost-efficient envelope components. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the authors.},

abstract = {The Italian building stock consists of buildings mainly constructed until the mid-20th century using pre-industrial construction techniques. These buildings require energy refurbishment that takes into account the preservation of their architectural heritage. In this view, this work studies an innovative integrated modelling and simulation framework consisting of the implementation of Historical Building Information Modeling (HBIM) for the energy retrofit of historical buildings with renewable geothermal HVAC system. To this aim, the field case study is part of a medieval complex in Central Italy (Perugia), as representative ancient rural offshore architecture in the European countryside. The system involves of a ground source heat pump, a water tank for thermal-energy storage connected to a low-temperature radiant system, and an air-handling unit. The building heating energy performance, typically influenced by thermal inertia in historical buildings, when coupled to the novel HVAC system, is comparatively assessed against a traditional scenario implementing a natural-gas boiler, and made inter-operative within the HBIM ad hoc platform. Results show that the innovative renewable energy system provides relevant benefits while preserving minor visual and architectural impact within the historical complex, and also in terms of both energy saving, CO2 emissions offset, and operation costs compared to the traditional existing system. The integrated HBIM approach may effectively drive the path toward regeneration and re-functioning of heritage in Europe. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

This requires the three parties involved, the government, the heating providers and the building occupants, to focus on energy policies that can encourage behavior towards energy saving. For this, the heating energy performance in the region should be evaluated and the energy benchmarks need to be extracted. This paper adopted a novel approach to derive the benchmarks of the existing building stock in a cold region of China. The benchmarking was done using a special technique based on the Lorenz curve, which was compared with two competing methods. The Lorenz curve method was proved to be the most adequate one among the three. It can extract the energy benchmarks based on the distribution rules of heating energy use intensity in relation to the cumulative building area. Besides, it is an efficient method when only limited building information or data is available. Based on the results, this study also discussed in what way policy incentives can focus on the relationship between heating fees and building energy performance in the severe cold climate zones of China. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Building energy renovations can efiectively improve the environmental performance and energy sustainability of existing buildings. From2007 onwards, the Chinese government has promoted energy-saving renovations of existing urban residential buildings. Nevertheless, various quality failures happen during the construction period in energy-saving renovation projects of residential buildings. Yet, the causes and their characters remain largely unknown. Through a literature review, this paper investigates the causes of quality failures. Validated through experts' interviews, a total of 18 causes were identified in building energy renovation projects. These causes were analyzed from two main aspects: The importance of a cause (related to impact and frequency), and the level of efiort required to address a cause (related to origin and scale), using both a questionnaire survey and a focus group. The results indicate that the critical causes of quality failures are working under high-cost and high-time pressure, adverse natural conditions, fraud of construction companies, incomplete construction site survey, poor checking procedures of supervisors, poor operational skilled workers, inadequate equipment performance, lack of experienced project managers, and incomplete building information in projects. The causes were classified as external and internal causes of building energy renovation projects. The outcome of this paper should aid policy makers and project coordinators to focus on critical causes of quality failures, and to develop efiective actions and policy interventions to achieve successful renovation projects with high-quality performance. {\textcopyright} 2020 MDPI AG.

A finite-horizon planning optimization problem is developed to control the operation of the BIM. The model can be implemented as a BEMS for the BIM to manipulate the indoor temperature and optimize the operation of the system's units. A centralized MPC-based algorithm is implemented for the power management scheduling of all sub-systems as well as power exchanges with the electrical grid. The MPC algorithm is verified over case studies applied to two floors residential building considering the climate condition of a typical day of March, where the effects of both loads and thermal resistance of building shell on the operation of the BIM are analyzed via numerical simulations. The analysis shows that 96{\%} of the total electrical load has been fulfilled by the local production where 23{\%} represents the total electric output of the micro-CHP and 73{\%} is the renewable energy production.

The more conventional choice and more frequently chosen option for building energy retrofit is vertical building envelope components, however, this paper presents the case study of a proposed retrofitting concept for the roof of an existing building. Using a simulation methodology, the research demonstrates how the proposed retrofitting concept improves the energy performance using electricity generated and external conduction gain as evaluation metrics. The proposed novel re-roofing concept consists of thermal insulation, waterproofing and electric energy generation properties. More specifically, the design concept includes a three-layer roofing system consisting of (from exterior toward interior): a PV panel, an EPDM membrane and an insulation layer.

Most of these methods are applied at the end of the project phase, with few opportunities to correct erroneous design decisions when the desired building energy performance is not achieved. It is demonstrated that there is no European standard for sustainability and that the decision-making process during the development of a building project is compromised by the methodologies and some concepts, as thermal inertia, are withdrawn. Currently, the industry has been developing alternative tools for evaluating energy performance and CO2 emissions in buildings over their entire life cycle. These software programs, which belong to the BIM environment, use databases and make simplifications adapted to the stage of design when the software can be applied. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate the accuracy of this software and how the databases and simplifications influence the decision-making process in building design. Calculation examples are carried out with various tools and compared to real building performance data. The results demonstrate that, as with the official methods, the tools influence the results and therefore condition, sometimes wrongly, the decision-making process to produce better buildings. {\textcopyright} 2019, {\textcopyright} 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\&} Francis Group.},

Accordingly, a Sustainability Performance Metric (SPM) framework was formulated using latent variable methods to manage sustainability indicators. The development of SPM was guided conceptually by sustainability principles and its implementation by objective and function statements. Single-family-detached housing was employed as a test of the concept. Corresponding datasets were generated using reliable models, specifically Athena Impact Estimator for Buildings, EnergyPlus, Building Information Modelling software, and an Input/Output socio-economic predictor. The results revealed the importance of observing all aspects of sustainability through a metric such as the SPM, the sensitivity of the SPM to the correlated factors, and the impacts of construction trends appearing in the North American marketplace on sustainability. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

This methodology describes the design of reversible assemblies, the addition of complementary information in the building information modeling (BIM), reinforced traceability, and the development of a material bank. At the same time, controlling the environmental impacts of reuse is planned by carrying out a life cycle assessment (LCA) at all stages of the project. Two scenarios for reuse design are applied with the toolchain proposed. A. "design from a stock" scenario, which leads to 100{\%} of elements being reused, using only elements from stock. B. "design with a stock" scenario, which seeks to integrate as many reused elements available in the stock as possible. The case study of a high-rise building deconstructed to rebuild a medium-rise building demonstrated that the developed toolchain allowed the inclusion of all reuse elements in a new structural calculation model. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the authors.},

abstract = {With current efforts to increase energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of buildings in the operational phase, the share of embedded energy (EE) and embedded GHG emissions is increasing. In early design stages, chances to influence these factors in a positive way are greatest, but very little and vague information about the future building is available. Therefore, this study introduces a building information modeling (BIM)-based method to analyze the contribution of the main functional parts of buildings to find embedded energy demand and GHG emission reduction potentials. At the same time, a sensitivity analysis shows the variance in results due to the uncertainties inherent in early design to avoid misleadingly precise results. The sensitivity analysis provides guidance to the design team as to where to strategically reduce uncertainties in order to increase precision of the overall results. A case study shows that the variability and sensitivity of the results differ between environmental indicators and construction types (wood or concrete). The case study contribution analysis reveals that the building's structure is the main contributor of roughly half of total GHG emissions if the main structural material is reinforced concrete. Exchanging reinforced concrete for a wood structure reduces total GHG emissions by 25{\%}, with GHG emissions of the structure contributing 33{\%} and windows 30{\%}. Variability can be reduced systematically by first reducing vagueness in geometrical and technical specifications and subsequently in the amount of interior walls. The study shows how a simplified and fast BIM-based calculation provides valuable guidance in early design stages. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the authors.},

abstract = {The development of a new tool (IEQCompass) for holistic evaluation of indoor environmental quality (IEQ) is presented. The purpose of the new tool is to facilitate a broader understanding of IEQ, its importance for comfort, health and well-being, and to help and guide the building design process regarding IEQ. The tool evaluates the potential indoor air quality (IAQ), thermal, visual and acoustic IEQ, without considering user influence. The evaluation uses 16 parameters, four for each of the four areas of IEQ (IAQ, thermal, visual and acoustic IEQ). These are evaluated based on relevant criteria assessed from blueprints, existing building information modelling data or observations during building inspection. The criteria and parameters are weighted to obtain an overall IEQ label for the building, as well as partial labels for the four areas. The labelling scheme uses letter ranking and colour code similar to that used in energy performance certification. The results are also communicated through the newly developed “IEQ Design Compass”, which is a detailed graphical visualisation at criteria level and helps identify potential IEQ problems that warrant attention. {\textcopyright} 2020 The Authors},

abstract = {This paper presents a data analytics model-based predictive control approach for a daylight–artificial light integrated scheme. The essential data are collected from an automated test room with dimmable LED luminaires and motorized Venetian blinds. This study considered machine learning techniques to develop a novel control strategy for all the four-window orientations for maintaining comfort and energy conservation. The shades are operated one at a time, and the annual data collected were used to develop the predictive models. The irradiance, altitude, temperature and daylight on the window are the predictors, and the blind position is the response variable to establish the models for the windows on all four sides of the test room. The standard support vector regression, Bayesian support vector regression and Gaussian process regression models are analysed in comparison with the baseline model. The luminaire dimming control signals generated using the predicted optimum blind position and exterior illuminance based on a building information illuminance model is commissioned for a given room. This approach mainly concentrated on the implementation of an industrial-level product by reducing the computational complexity of the rule-based blind positioning system. At present, the models are in a reconfigurable embedded WiFi-enabled operating system. {\textcopyright} The Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers 2019.},

abstract = {The global shift towards embodied carbon reduction in the building sector has indicated the need for a detailed analysis of environmental impacts across the whole lifecycle of buildings. The environmental impact of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems has rarely been studied in detail. Most of the published studies are based on assumptions and rule of thumb techniques. In this study, the requirements and methods to perform a detailed life cycle assessment (LCA) for HVAC systems based on building information modelling (BIM) are assessed and framed for the first time. The approach of linking external product data information to objects using visual programming language (VPL) is tested, and its benefits over the existing workflows are presented. The detailed BIM model of a newly built office building in Switzerland is used as a case study. In addition, detailed project documentation is used to ensure the plausibility of the calculated impact. The LCA results show that the embodied impact of the HVAC systems is three times higher than the targets provided by the Swiss Energy Efficiency Path (SIA 2040). Furthermore, it is shown that the embodied impact of HVAC systems lies in the range of 15-36{\%} of the total embodied impact of office buildings. Nevertheless, further research and similar case studies are needed to provide a robust picture of the embodied environmental impact of HVAC systems. The results could contribute to setting stricter targets in line with the vision of decarbonization of the building sector. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the authors.},

abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) is increasingly used throughout the facility's life cycle for various applications, such as design, construction, facility management, and maintenance. For existing buildings, the geometry of as-built BIM is often constructed using dense, three dimensional (3D) point clouds data obtained with laser scanners. Traditionally, as-built BIM systems do not contain the material and textural information of the buildings' elements. This paper presents a semi-automatic method for generation of material and texture rich as-built BIM. The method captures and integrates material and textural information of building elements into as-built BIM using thermal infrared sensing (TIS). The proposed method uses TIS to capture thermal images of the interior walls of an existing building. These images are then processed to extract the interior walls using a segmentation algorithm. The digital numbers in the resulted images are then transformed into radiance values that represent the emitted thermal infrared radiation. Machine learning techniques are then applied to build a correlation between the radiance values and the material type in each image. The radiance values were used to extract textural information from the images. The extracted textural and material information are then robustly integrated into the as-built BIM providing the data needed for the assessment of building conditions in general including energy efficiency, among others. {\textcopyright} 2020 Techno-Press, Ltd.},

As this material has high initial moisture content, prior thermal treatment using drying is necessary. In this work, mathematical modelling of the single particle drying kinetics of acai berry waste was performed. The experimental conditions were: temperature of 42 °C and 57 °C and gas velocity of 1.8 m{\textperiodcentered}s−1. Non-isothermal model consisted of differential equations based on macroscopic energy balance and on the differential form of the analytical solution of the diffusive model. The estimated values of h were 47.78 W{\textperiodcentered}m−2{\textperiodcentered}°C−1 at 42 °C and 42.55 W{\textperiodcentered}m−2{\textperiodcentered}°C−1 at 57 °C and for D0 and Ea were 1.39 × 10−4 m2{\textperiodcentered}min−1 and 26.88 kJ{\textperiodcentered}mol−1 at 42 °C, respectively, and 2.94 × 10−4 m2{\textperiodcentered}min−1 and 25.05 kJ{\textperiodcentered}mol−1 at 57 °C, respectively. The optimum value of Bim was equal to 2.5. The results showed that the non-isothermal model gave good predictions for both temperature and moisture content of the solid during drying. It was verified that there was not a significative dependence of the moisture diffusion with the heating rate of the solid. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Apoptosis is a key cell death pathway in mammalian cells. Understanding this process and its regulation has been a subject of study in the last three decades. Members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins are involved in the regulation of apoptosis through mitochondrial poration with the subsequent initiation of apoptosis. Deregulation of proapoptotic proteins contributes to the progression of many tumor processes. Understanding how these pore-forming Bcl-2 proteins Bak and Bax are activated is key to find new anticancer treatments. As no drug capable of activating Bak has been disclosed yet, the study of the structural features of BH3 peptides-known as Bak activators-relevant for binding along with its binding energy decomposition analysis, becomes essential for designing novel small-molecule mimics of BH3. Interestingly, a BH3 Bim analogue-inactivating Bak has recently been discovered, opening a question on the molecular features that determine the functions of BH3 peptides. Therefore, the present work is aimed at understanding the way BH3 peptides activate or inactivate Bak in order to identify differential structural features that can be used in drug design. For this purpose, complexes of Bak with an activator and an inhibitor have been subjected to a molecular dynamics study. Structural differences were assessed by means of the fluctuations of the corresponding principal components. Moreover, the MMPB/GBSA approach was used to compute the binding free energy of the diverse complexes to identify those residues of the BH3 peptide that exhibit the larger contributions to complex formation. The results obtained in this work show differences between activators and inhibitors, both in structural and energetic terms, which can be used in the design of new molecules that can activate or inactivate proapoptotic Bak.

abstract = {The building sector accounts for 40{\%} of the energy use and one-third of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions globally. Buildings deteriorate with age, which leads to a decrease in their energy performance. Therefore, it is significant to improve the energy performance of aging building block although it is challenging. The two main decision paths for municipalities are renovation and reconstruction. This study investigated the above options for the older housing stock in a densely populated urban centre in British Columbia, Canada. A scenario-based analysis approach was taken to evaluate the life cycle GHG emissions of six different renovation and reconstruction scenarios. The total life cycle emissions were calculated for each scenario including the embodied and operational emission, and the emissions from building construction and maintenance. A BIM-LCA combined approach was used to assess the embodied GHG emissions with the SimaPro software. HOT2000 software was used to model the operational GHG emissions. The results show that in the reconstruction scenarios, around 40{\%} of the emissions are from the material manufacturing stage. The embodied emissions generated from the reconstruction scenarios are 5–6 times higher than the renovation scenarios. The life cycle GHG emissions of the existing house can be reduced by applying renovations, with the emissions saving gradually increasing with the level of retrofitting. The passive house reconstruction scenario delivers the greatest benefit in terms of life cycle emissions reduction compared to all other scenarios. In terms of the GHG emission intensity per unit area, the newly-built houses in scenarios 5 and 6 also have lower life cycle GHG emission per square meter than the renovated existing houses in scenario 1–4 after 15 and 10 years to breakeven respectively. Based on this, it can be concluded that when considering the older existing building stock, a careful weighing of options must take place before making the decision on replacing them with new construction. However, it is also important to consider the economic and social aspects before making decisions to renovate or replace existing houses. The study outcomes will support city planners and urban development planners to make decisions on BC aging building stock development, especially in high population density neighbourhoods. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {The development of nonprecious metal–nitrogen–carbon (M-N-C) materials with efficient metal utilization and abundant active sites for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is of great significance for fuel cells and metal–air batteries. Ultrasmall 2 D CoxZn2−x(benzimidazole)4 [CoxZn2−x(bim)4] bimetallic metal–organic framework (MOF) nanosheets (≈2 nm thick) are synthesized by a novel bottom-up strategy and then thermally converted into a core–shell structure of sub-5 nm Co nanodots (NDs) wrapped with 2 to 5 layers of Co,N-codoped graphene (Co@FLG). The size of the Co NDs in Co@FLG could be precisely controlled by the Co/Zn ratio in the CoxZn2−x(bim)4 nanosheet. As an ORR electrocatalyst, the optimized Co@FLG exhibits an excellent half-wave potential of 0.841 V (vs. RHE), a high limiting current density of 6.42 mA cm−2, and great stability in alkaline electrolyte. Co@FLG also has great ORR performance in neutral electrolyte, as well as in Mg–air batteries. The experimental studies and DFT calculations reveal that the high performance of Co@FLG is mainly attributed to its great O2 absorptivity, which is endowed by the abundant Co−Nx and pyridinic-N in the FLG shell and the strong electron-donating ability from the Co ND core to the FLG shell. This elevates the eg orbital energy of CoII and lowers the activation energy for breaking the O=O/O−O bonds. This work sheds light on the design and fabrication of 2 D MOFs and MOF-derived M-N-C materials for energy storage and conversion applications. {\textcopyright} 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co.

Thus, selecting appropriate Architectural Design Features (ADFs) at the early design stage provides significant opportunities to control heat flows, maximize building energy performance, reduce excessive energy consumption cost, and preserve a comfortable temperature for occupants. In this research, an Architectural-Based Energy Impact Scoring System (AEISS) was developed based on inputs from 10 expert architects, and it consists of seven ADFs and 40 multiple design options. The proposed system provides a simple decision scoring system for designers to evaluate design alternatives and optimize the energy consumption of buildings in the early design phase. A simple user-friendly program for the AEISS was developed to assist the designers in generating the design alternatives scores. Energy simulation analyses were performed to validate the applicability of the proposed AEISS by integrating 3-D BIM models of three different design alternatives of a residential building in Saudi Arabia with Ecotect analysis software. A detailed analysis was performed to evaluate the energy impact of the selected ADFs and to compare the alternatives in terms of energy consumptions and cost-efficiency. The simulation results proved that the proposed AEISS gave responsive results and is capable of providing stakeholders with the optimum decision to select the design alternative with high energy performance and low consumption cost. {\textcopyright} 2020},

However, maintaining and refurbishing existing buildings often contributes to higher risk and cost. In addition, more buildings are required to undertake building assessment schemes such as Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM), Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), Green Star, Green Mark, and Green Building Index (GBI)–most were not designed to assess existing buildings. In this sense, laser scanning can be used to collect existing parametric building data as point clouds, which can be developed and used for modelling of energy consumption, comfort and costing.

abstract = {In Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) building information modeling (BIM), the objectified concept of a space boundary (SB) provides a means to define building space geometries with surface entities. Such building-geometry definitions are widely used for various engineering applications such as energy simulation, lighting analysis, and facility management. However, quality issues (i.e., geometric and nongeometric issues) of SBs have been widely reported, which makes it necessary to validate the SBs before retrieving them from IFC models for relevant applications. Unfortunately, there is still a lack of reliable mechanisms/tools to automatically evaluate the quality of SBs, especially the geometric quality. This study proposes a Monte Carlo ray tracing approach to automatically detect geometric errors in SBs. The approach checks SBs space by space in terms of whether each space is correctly bounded by its SBs. The geometric errors in the set of SBs of a space that the approach can detect include gaps, overhangs, and overlaps between SBs as well as incorrect surface normal directions of SBs. To accelerate the ray tracing process in the approach, the axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) tree is implemented to spatially index SBs of each space. The approach is evaluated with extensive performance tests in terms of robustness and efficiency. The results show that the approach can robustly and efficiently detect all four types of geometric errors even in extreme cases and that the AABB tree helps speed up the approach significantly for large-scale IFC models with many complex spaces. {\textcopyright} 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract = {The early stages of building design involve the consideration of different design variants and their assessment regarding various performance criteria including energy consumption and costs. During the design process, the involved experts from different disciplines frequently exchange building information to develop a design that satisfies the project's requirements and objectives. In the course of this iterative process, the building design evolves throughout multiple refinement stages. At the same time, different variants are developed. In BIM-based projects, the maturity of the design information provided by the model is expressed by the notion of Level of development (LOD). So far, however, there is no method to formally define the information requirements of a LOD. In particular, there are no means for expressing the uncertainty involved with the provided information. By contrast, despite the insufficient information available in early design stages, a BIM model appears precise and certain. This situation leads to false assumptions and model evaluations, for example, in the case of energy efficiency calculations or structural analysis. Hence, this paper presents an overview of a set of approaches that were developed to alleviate and preserve the consistency of the designed solutions. The approach includes the development of a multi-LOD meta-model, which allows one to explicitly describe the LOD requirements of each building component type incorporating the possible uncertainties, e.g. concerning the building dimensions. On the basis of this multi-LOD model, methods for evaluating a building design's performance regarding the building's structure and life cycle energy performance are proposed that take the defined uncertainties into account. To support the management of design variants in one consistent model, a graph-based approach is introduced. Finally, a minimized communication protocol is described to facilitate the workflow and communicate the evaluation results for supporting the decision-making process. {\textcopyright} 2020 The author(s).

abstract = {Implementing China's emission reduction regulations requires a design approach that integrates specific architectural and functional properties of railway stations with low greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. This article analyzes life cycle GHG emissions related to materials production, replacement and operational energy use to identify design drivers and reduction strategies implemented in high-speed railway station (HSRS) buildings. A typical middle-sized HSRS building in a cold climate zone in China is studied. A detailed methodology was proposed for the development and assessment of emission reduction strategies through life cycle assessment (LCA), combined with a building information model (BIM). The results reveal that operational emissions contribute the most to total GHG emissions, constituting approximately 81{\%} while embodied material emissions constitute 19{\%}, with 94 kgCO2eq/m2{\textperiodcentered}a and 22 kgCO2eq/m2{\textperiodcentered}a respectively. Optimizing space can reduce operational GHG emissions and service life extension of insulation materials contributes to a 15{\%} reduction in embodied GHG emissions. In all three scenarios, the reduction potentials of space, envelope, and material type optimization were 28.2{\%}, 13.1{\%}, and 3.5{\%} and that measures for reduced life cycle emissions should focus on space in the early stage of building design. This study addresses the research gap by investigating the life cycle GHG emissions from HSRS buildings and reduction strategies to help influence the design decisions of similar projects and large space public buildings which are critical for emission reduction on a larger scale. {\textcopyright} 2020 by the authors.},

abstract = {Smart buildings are the trend of the next generation's commercial buildings that link different building systems together with the Building Automation System (BAS). Building information modeling (BIM) assists in data exchange and information flow. Previous research has explored BAS and BIM integration for energy management, building design optimization and operation, and building fault detection and diagnostics. However, it is rarely seen to design BAS or exchange BAS information in different project stages using BIM tools. The current design of the BAS system is either using 2D drawings based on AutoCAD or vendor customized tools. Unlike the other building systems, BAS seldom participates in design-build BIM cycle but blends into facility management in the later stage. To tackle this issue, this research aims to set a fundamental step to facilitate information exchange for BIM assisted BAS design and operation using one of the BAS open communication protocol named Building Automation and Control Networks (BACnet) and open BIM standard Industry Foundation Class (IFC). This paper leverages Information Delivery Manual (IDM) and Model View Definition (MVD) methodologies to define an IFC subset schema (a BACnet MVD) so that BAS information conforming to the BACnet protocol can be represented in IFC data model for information exchange throughout various project stages with BIM tools. Revit and a web browser were used to demonstrate the implementation of the BACnet MVD for BAS information exchange. In this way, BAS information represented in the open BIM standard can unlock the potential of future smart building information exchange and integration. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {During building design and especially in early stages, important decisions influencing the lifecycle-based energy demand of buildings are made. Life Cycle Energy Assessment (LCEA) is used to evaluate this energy demand already in early stages of design. However, at that point, the building design and the related information can quickly change and are subject to potentially large uncertainty. This uncertainty in building information influences the LCEA and therefore decisions taken by the designer. Due to the uncertainty, it is difficult to distinguish between the performance of different design variants to decide for the best option. This study presents a method to perform LCEA and to assess and consequently strategically reduce the influence of uncertainties in buildings' information on the LCEA in early design stages. Uncertainty analysis is used to assess the influence of uncertainty on LCEA and to prioritize decisions to reduce uncertainty. The method is embedded in a multi-Level of Development (LOD) modelling approach covering the development of the building during the early stages of design. The method is applied to seven different building shapes as a proof of concept. It is concluded that the method renders valid results to assess the project-specific uncertainty in LCEA results. {\textcopyright} 2019},

The first step for maintaining energy is to find a way to reduce consumption and save money, which means less cost, fuel and pollution. Hence, there is a need to look for the necessary infrastructure to reduce the use of and distribute optimal energy. In this paper, the Taguchi method for energy modelling (EM) optimisation is proposed to predict the best location for heating and cooling appliances. Here, all information about one of the units of the Toos Arman Star Apartment Hotel located in Mashhad, Iran, was obtained. Based on fundamental analysis, the major factors are building coordinates (X, Y, and Z). According to the major factors, orthogonal array L25 is engaged for Taguchi experiments. The authors tried to maximise the satisfaction of building residents by defining the fitness function approaching to thermal comfort point of 25°C. Based on L25 of Taguchi experiments, the best successful result is analysed to select the level of major factors. The result of Taguchi optimisation was introduced into Comsol Multiphysics software and EM was performed using the determined critical points again. The experimental results show the successful location for cooling and heating appliances compared to the initial design of room 1. {\textcopyright} 2020 ICE Publishing. All rights reserved.},

Macro-scale energy consumption data during a period of seven years were gathered alongside cross-sectional buildings information. Eight years of daily outdoor temperature data were recorded and stored for every half hour. This dataset was eventually used to calculate heating and cooling degree-days. The weather factor was recognized as the variable with the greatest impact on campus energy consumption, and as the coefficient indicated a strong correlation, a linear regression model was established to forecast future energy use. A threshold of 8 GWh has been estimated as the energy consumption limit to be achieved despite the growth of the university.

This model-based control technique uses the optimal control theory to provide a constraint compliant, anticipative control, maximizing performance criteria. However, building and calibrating a reliable model for a real application is difficult, costly and time-consuming. Indeed, it requires hard expert work to retrieve all the building's data and tune the corresponding model. This prevents MPC to be widespread in Building Management Systems. In this paper, we propose a MPC formulation where all the optimization problems included in a MPC strategy (calibration, estimation, optimal control) are performed efficiently using gradient-based techniques and adjoint-based gradient computations. This formulation relies on an automated “white-box” modeling technique (with partial-differential equations) using Building Information Model (BIM - using gbXML standard here) files parsing. We also show that making extensive use of adjoint models in MPC opens opportunities for fast sensitivity analysis, which can, for instance, help to choose which parameters to calibrate. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

A key benefit of collating data through Historic Building Information Modelling (HBIM) should be to assist others facing similar challenges. Here, examples for sharing understanding of how components belong to a system are outlined in the context of a newly completed dataset of public library buildings in the UK funded by Andrew Carnegie, predominantly built between 1900 and 1914. Demands for the functionality and economy of public library buildings, coupled with the emergent standardisation of building components at the time, provide a specific condition with potential for further iteration to other buildings of the period or related typologies. The work highlights the urgency of providing cost-efficient knowledge sharing structures in an era of altered priorities with respect to energy use for modern heritage. We propose the means for mapping common features to network knowledge amongst stakeholders through relevant open source pathways.

abstract = {Within the context of amongst others urban energy planning and energy system design, urban and district energy simulations have gained interest to quantify the energy use of existing districts. To reduce calculation time and in absence of adequate detailed building level data, urban energy simulations often deploy reductive modelling approaches based on a limited set of buildings, or archetype buildings. This may lead to significant modelling errors when the archetype buildings are not tailored to the studied location. This paper explores a building clustering approach that harvests available local building information, e.g. geospatial data, to generate a tailored set of archetype buildings. Focussed on simulating the annual heat demand or peak heat demand, this paper evaluates if clustering on building properties can be an alternative to clustering on the energy key performance indicators of interest to define the tailored archetypes. As consumption data on a building level is often not available, such an approach would eliminate the need to simulate the energy use for all buildings. The results show that indeed clustering on the properties is a viable alternative with robust results for both annual energy use and peak energy demand and a comparable accuracy compared to clustering on the targeted performance indicators. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This study performs a comparative environmental and economic assessment of four different fa{\c{c}}ade systems for low-cost residential buildings in Ghana. A framework is designed to incorporate BIM, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC) to perform a holistic comparison of a Shotcrete Insulated Composite Fa{\c{c}}ade (Shotcrete ICF), Galvanised Steel Insulated Composite fa{\c{c}}ade (G. Steel ICF) and Stabilised Earth Block Fa{\c{c}}ade (SEBF) against the conventional Concrete Block and Mortar Fa{\c{c}}ade (CBMF). BIM models are developed to compute the environmental and economic impacts of each fa{\c{c}}ade. The results are then subjected to a comparative analysis for different life cycle stages. The SEBF is proved to be the most sustainable facade as it reduces cumulative energy demand (CED) by 39.13 {\%}, global warming potential (GWP) by 18.07 {\%} and LCC by 47.87 {\%} compared to CBMF. The Shotcrete IFC and G. Steel IFC are found to increase CED but decrease GWP. Other than the SEBF, the ranking of all fa{\c{c}}ades under different indicators changes through the scenario analysis. The findings of this study provide useful guidelines for selecting facade systems and reducing the environmental and economic impacts of low-cost residential buildings in Ghana. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Urban sustainability assessment frameworks have emerged during the past decade to address holistically the complexity of the urban landscape through a systems approach, factoring in environmental, social and economic requirements. However, the current assessment schemes are (a) static in nature, and as such don't reflect the dynamic and real-time nature of urban artefacts, (b) are not grounded in semantics (e.g. BIM and GIS), and (c) are at best used to assist in regulatory compliance, for instance in energy design, to meet increasingly stringent regulatory requirements. Information and communication technologies provide a new value proposition capitalizing on the Internet of Things (IoT) and semantics to provide real-time insights and inform decision making. Consequently, there is a real need in the field for data models that could facilitate data exchange and handle data heterogeneity. In this study, a semantic data model is considered to support near real-time urban sustainability assessment and enhance the semantics of sensor network data. Based on an extensive review of urban sustainability assessment frameworks and ontology development methodologies, the Urban District Sustainability Assessment (UDSA) ontology has been developed and validated using real data from the site of “The Works”, a newly refurbished neighbourhood in Ebbw Vale, Wales. This novel approach reconciles several domain-specific ontologies within one high-level ontology that can support the creation of real-time urban sustainability assessment software. In addition, this information model is aligned with 29 authoritative urban sustainability assessment frameworks, thus providing a useful resource not only in urban sustainability assessment, but also in the wider smart cities context. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {This research presents a new occupancy schedule modeling system in a building information modeling (BIM) environment called stations-oriented indoor localization (SOIL). Occupant monitoring, data collection, and analysis are the main challenges when estimating occupancy patterns, especially in large-scale buildings. SOIL utilizes existing network infrastructure (Wi-Fi) and a clustering method to collect and sort occupancy data. These clusters are then mapped onto a BIM model to generate room-level occupancy schedules. In this research, the SOIL system was tested for 10 weekdays on 26 subjects and two operation scenarios in an educational building that included three office spaces and one open studio space. The results show that the SOIL system was able to detect indoor occupants' room-level locations with a 93{\%} level of accuracy, and efficiently generate occupancy schedules in a BIM environment. The main contribution of this SOIL system is the development of a BIM-integrated occupant localization system using existing network infrastructure, a process that has great potential to save energy and assist in the efficient management of a building's renovation, construction, and operation. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) is the application of {\`{a}} computer-based model to analyse building design, material and its operation. By applying BIM into construction industry, designers are able to evaluate the level of sustain ability of their design. In addition, BIM helps building professionals to have a realistic full life cycle assessment of a building in early design stage and conduct the energy analysis even before a building is build. Energy performance evaluation report generated by BIM through software such as ArchiCAD is capable to aid the building professionals towards designing a sustainable building. Reduction on energy consumption of one building can beachieved through many ways. For instance, by selecting a suitable material for building opening, fa{\c{c}}ade as well as selecting efficient appliances/equipment, a building could reduce its energy consumption. In this research, the ground floor of the Chancellery building in Universiti Malaya (UM) is modelled and used as a reference block. The effect of the existing glazing materials and type of lighting (Ao) towards the building energy performance are analysed. Alternatively, a better option of glazing materials and efficient lighting (Bo) are proposed onto the same reference block. The finding encompasses three different aspect of energy efficiency i.e. energy consumption, energy cost and carbone mission from both the existing building design as well as the alternative combination. The alternative combination had proved that an efficient and proper building material and design selection could lead to energy and cost saving as well as the reduction of carbone mission release from a building. In this case, the results shown that the effect of each aspect is 11{\%}, 14{\%} and 14{\%} respectively. Methods of minimizing the utilization of energy in office buildings are presented as well. {\textcopyright} 2019 SERSC.},

This paper aims to provide systematic and comprehensive insights on current trends and future potentials of green BIM research by analyzing the existing literature with their research features (i.e. research backgrounds, goals, methods and outputs). In total, 80 publications have been collected, analyzed and discussed. The results show that among ten main BPA types, energy {\&} thermal analysis, green building rating analysis, and cost and benefit analysis are the most studied. However, wind {\&} ventilation analysis, acoustic analysis, and water efficiency analysis receive little attention. Moreover, more research focusing on integrated design analysis should be carried out for optimal design outcome. In addition, most of the collected literature research on the capability of data integration and analysis of green BIM tools, while their capability of visualization and documentation has limited examination. Furthermore, most researchers utilized one main software package while utilization of information exchange formats (IEF) is limited. To increase interoperability of green BIM tools, how different BIM authoring tools and IEFs can be utilized for BPA requires further investigation. {\textcopyright} 2020 The author(s).},

This project aims to develop the concept of “communicating concretes,” which are concrete elements embedding wireless sensor networks, for applications dedicated to Structure Health Monitoring in the construction industry. Due to applicative constraints, the topology of the wireless sensor network follows a chain-based structure. Node batteries cannot be replaced or easily recharged, it is crucial to evaluate the energy consumed by each node during the monitoring process. This area has been extensively studied leading to different energy models to evaluate energy consumption for chain-based structures. However, no simple, practical, and analytical network energy models have yet been proposed. Energy evaluation models of periodic data collection for chain-based structures are proposed. These models are compared and evaluated with an Arduino XBee–based platform. Experimental results show the mean prediction error of our models is 5{\%}. Realizing aggregation at nodes significantly reduces energy consumption and avoids hot-spot problem with homogeneous consumptions along the chain. Models give an approximate lifetime of the wireless sensor network and communicating concretes services. They can also be used online by nodes for a self-assessment of their energy consumptions. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2020.},

With the advancement of computing power and data analysis techniques, it is now possible to analyze user information using big data techniques. Here, we endeavored to integrate user information with the physical characteristics of residential buildings to analyze how these elements impact energy consumption. Regression analysis was conducted to accurately identify the impact of each element on energy consumption. It was found that six elements were influential in all seasons: the number of exterior walls, housing direction, housing area, number of years occupied, number of household members, and the occupation of the household head. The elements that had an impact in each period were then derived. Based on the results of the regression analysis, input variables for the training of an artificial neural network (ANN) model were selected for each period, and residential energy consumption prediction models were implemented based on actual consumption. The elements identified as those affecting energy consumption, through regression analysis, can be used for implementing prediction models with advanced forms. This study is significant in that we derived influential elements from an integrative perspective. {\textcopyright} 2019 by the authors.},

abstract = {The main source of building energy consumption in Iran is fossil fuels. The building sector, as a result, is responsible for a high share of CO2 emissions in this country. To address the issue, the government has recently adopted the “green management system” policy in order to alleviate the severe rate of CO2 emissions from the government buildings. As a commitment to the policy, the University of Tehran plans to transform into the first green university of Iran through green retrofitting in the coming years. As the first step to the retrofitting process, this paper measures the potential of energy-saving and CO2 emission reduction in the University of Tehran Science {\&} Technology Park (UTSTP) offices with the use of Building Information Modeling (BIM). For this, Building No. 2 of UTSTP is modeled in the environment of DesignBuilder software to provide a calibrated computational model for energy and carbon audit. A detailed audit is then conducted using the calibrated model to identify the major areas of energy loss in the case study. Based on the audit results, several green strategies are then proposed to improve the weak performance of building in the identified areas. The strategies include triple glazing windows, aerogel envelope, phase change material (PCM) insulation, and Trombe wall. Findings suggest that the thermal loss from the building structure as a result of insufficient levels of insulation in the building components is the main source of energy loss in the building. Simulation results show that green strategies to a large extent have good energy-saving and mitigation potential. Full implementation of the proposed green strategies would reduce the annual heating needs and CO2 emissions of the case study by 51.6{\%} and 5.39{\%} respectively. {\textcopyright} 2020 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Wastes of buildings constitute a considerable amount of these concerns. Thus, management has to be started in buildings and continue throughout districts and cities level. In this study, a big scale building was investigated based on its current waste management system via LCA methodology to assess waste management strategies through the building's lifetime. Within the developed methodology, the building's wastes were categorized into 3 group as municipal solid waste, wastewater and demolition waste. Firstly, the capacities of all waste types were calculated which were used as input in the developed LCA model. Additionally, existing energy performance model and Building Information Model of the building as well as specifications from Turkish Statistical Institute were utilized. Two indicators were defined to show impact of wastes; cumulative energy demand (CED) and global warming potential (GWP). The energy consumption of the building was included in LCA methodology to compose a comparative scheme between the energy usage of building and energy usage of the building's waste management. The results showed that there was an energy recovery potential from wastes due to recycling processes; nonetheless, this potential was low compared to the building's operational energy. In addition to the CED, overall greenhouse gases release from the waste management strategies affected the environment negatively while there was a reduction potential by recycling processes. {\textcopyright} 2020 WITPress.

Therefore, building owners and managers have been known to adjust environmental physical parameters such as temperature, humidity, and air quality based on people's subjective sensations to yield satisfactory feelings of comfort.

To achieve the aforementioned objectives, this study undertook the following four tasks: first, providing visualization and smart suggestion functions to assist building managers and users in analyzing and developing plans based on the demands of space usage and electrical equipment; second, using Internet of Things technology to minimize the difference between real situations and those simulated in building information modeling (BIM); third, accurately evaluating interior environment comfort levels and improving equipment operating efficiency based on quantized comfort levels; and fourth, establishing a persuasive workflow for building energy saving systems.

abstract = {Buildings have a significant impact on global sustainability. During the past decades, a wide variety of studies have been conducted throughout the building lifecycle for improving the building performance. Data-driven approach has been widely adopted owing to less detailed building information required and high computational efficiency for online applications. Recent advances in information technologies and data science have enabled convenient access, storage, and analysis of massive on-site measurements, bringing about a new big-data-driven research paradigm. This paper presents a critical review of data-driven methods, particularly those methods based on larger datasets, for building energy modeling and their practical applications for improving building performances. This paper is organized based on the four essential phases of big-data-driven modeling, i.e., data preprocessing, model development, knowledge post-processing, and practical applications throughout the building lifecycle. Typical data analysis and application methods have been summarized and compared at each stage, based upon which in-depth discussions and future research directions have been presented. This review demonstrates that the insights obtained from big building data can be extremely helpful for enriching the existing knowledge repository regarding building energy modeling. Furthermore, considering the ever-increasing development of smart buildings and IoT-driven smart cities, the big data-driven research paradigm will become an essential supplement to existing scientific research methods in the building sector. {\textcopyright} 2020, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract = {The concept of multi-Level-of-Development (multi-LOD) modelling represents a flexible approach of information management and compilation in building information modelling (BIM) on a set of consistent levels. From an energy perspective during early architectural design, the refinement of design parameters by addition of information allows a more precise prediction of building performance. The need for energy-efficient buildings requires a designer to focus on the parameters in order of their ability to reduce uncertainty in energy performance to prioritise energy relevant decisions. However, there is no method for assigning and prioritising information for a particular level of multi-LOD. In this study, we performed a sensitivity analysis of energy models to estimate the uncertainty caused by the design parameters in energy prediction. This study allows to rank the design parameters in order of their influence on the energy prediction and determine the information required at each level of multi-LOD approach. We have studied the parametric energy model of different building shapes representing architectural design variation at the early design stage. A variance-based sensitivity analysis method is used to calculate the uncertainty contribution of each design parameter. The three levels in the uncertainty contribution by the group of parameters are identified which form the basis of information required at each level of multi-LOD BIM approach. The first level includes geometrical parameters, the second level includes technical specification and operational design parameters, and the third level includes window construction and system efficiency parameters. These findings will be specifically useful in the development of a multi-LOD approach to prioritise performance relevant decisions at early design phases. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

In this study, the UCS of rock and bursting liability index of rock including elastic energy index (WET), impact energy index (WCF), elastic strain energy index (ES), and modified values of brittleness index (BIM) were measured by laboratory tests. These tests were implemented in six different MC (0, 0.58, 1.06, 1.82, 2.43, and 2.80{\%}) and 20 F-T cycles. The relationship between rock mechanical properties, bursting liability of rock, and MC after freeze-thaw damage was established, and the control mechanism of moisture content on mechanical properties and rockburst tendency of rocks in cold regions was revealed. Uniaxial compressive test results showed that the UCS of rock decreases significantly with the increase of MC. Under the action of F-T cycles, WET, WCF, and ES decrease with the increase of MC, and BIM of rock increases gradually. This indicates that the rockburst tendency of sandstone decreases with the increase of MC. To calculate WET, WCF, ES, and BIM of sandstone samples, new empirical equations were established and put forward under different MC after 20 F-T cycles. {\textcopyright} 2020 Kesheng Li et al.},

NZEB design includes a reduction of current energy demands and the balance between consumption and on-site energy generation without compromising indoor comfort conditions. Building designers are using building information modeling (BIM) and building energy simulation (BES) tools to validate design decisions and to evaluate energy balance in buildings. However, the flow of information between BIM software and BES tools has not been solved yet. This work proposes a method to address the decision-making process at three different stages of the building design. Initially, the use of BIM over the architectural design process helps architects to make meaningful decisions related to the passive solar heat gains and envelop materials. Secondly, a more advanced BES is used to analyze the strategies of ventilation and the influence of heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Finally, a new method to integrate water flow glazing (WFG) is implemented to increase the comfort in those areas of the building with a large area of glass. Applying the right strategy for natural ventilation can reduce the thermal loads by 45{\%} in Summer. Using WFG minimizes the gap between indoor air temperature and operative temperature according to the results. {\textcopyright} 2019 Published by peer-reviewed open access scientific journal.},

abstract = {The objective of this study is to develop a framework for the selection of construction systems of low and medium rise buildings used in residential, office and commercial applications. The construction systems considered are reinforced concrete framing (RC), structural steel framing (SS) and cold-formed steel framing (CFS). The framework is developed in accordance with the relevant guidelines for life cycle analysis and sustainability and is intended to support decision making in the design stage. The system boundary for the study is from cradle-to-grave, including all cost components from construction stage, use stage and disposal stage in addition to possible recycling/reuse options. The developed framework integrates building information modeling, energy simulation modeling and end of life scenarios to calculate and compare life cycle costs and sustainability advantages of construction system alternatives. All future costs are discounted to their present value using the appropriate interest rates. Uncertainties in the input parameters are modeled using realistic probability distributions and then used in a Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis to investigate the impact of changes in the input parameters on the result. Application of the developed system to a university building revealed the following results. The total life cycle cost is nearly the same for RC framing system and CFS framing system, while the life cycle cost of SS framing system is 13.4{\%} more. When the system is credited for possible revenues resulting from early operation and recycling/reuse, the total life cycle cost of the RC framing system and the SS framing system become nearly the same while the life cycle cost of the CFS framing system becomes 22{\%} less. Sensitivity analysis of the results shows that the discount rate has the most effect on the estimated mean cost followed by the inflation rate and the construction cost. The sustainability assessment focuses on calculating the LEED points associated with material recycling/reuse potentials and waste management. {\textcopyright} 2019},

abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Energy Simulation have both become increasingly important tools in the building sector. The potential exists to achieve a synergistic relationship between BIM and energy simulation software programs by leveraging information stored within BIM models to inform energy models to save time and improve a design's performance. This study seeks to understand the perceptions of green design stakeholders with regard to the value of BIM-based energy simulation as well as associated barriers and benefits. To do so, an e-survey was used to collect data. Data analysis consisted of descriptive statistics, Cronbach's Alpha coefficients, Spearman correlations, and Mann-Whitney U tests. Results suggest that little to no correlation exists between green design stakeholders' perceptions regarding the value of using information from BIMs to inform energy simulation, and their engagement level with BIM and/or energy simulation. While this study has been limited by its sample size and location of participants, the results help identify different user groups' perceptions and receptiveness to using BIM-based energy simulation tools, which are advancing and transforming the AEC industry. Studies, such as this, emphasize the need for further research on understanding the modeling processes related to energy simulation and BIM models. {\textcopyright} 2019, College Publishing.

abstract = {With the growing energy and economic crises, the need for optimization of energy consumption in the design and construction of buildings has recently become even more significant. This study aimed to determine the best combinations of building-envelope materials with the consideration of influential and uncontrollable factors for energy-efficient design in Malaysia. Residential buildings in Malaysia consume a significant amount of electrical energy for air-conditioning purposes. A typical one-storey terrace house was selected as a case study, and building information modeling (BIM) applications were used to simulate its energy performance. The selected case study was modeled using the Autodesk Revit Software and exported to the EnergyPlus software for energy analysis. In order to optimize the number of examinations in the simulation software, the effect of noise factors was assessed using the Taguchi method. The current energy-consumption patterns were identified and converted into the optimized options in component types. The results of this novel approach provide appropriate information about the performance of the modified energy-efficient material in building components with consideration of noise factors to achieve more reliable outcomes. It was concluded that the appropriate selection of ceiling, window, wall, roof, and floor components could greatly increase energy efficiency in descending order. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {3D printing is becoming increasingly popular for construction owing to its reduced environmental impact and lower energy demand than conventional manufacturing. Rapid application of this technology relies largely on the development of high-performance cement-based composites compatible with 3D printers. This study aims to develop high-quality and sustainable cement-based composites containing microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) that can satisfy the requirements for 3D printing. The workability, rheological behavior, buildability, and mechanical properties of the cement-based composites for 3D printing were examined systematically. The rheological analysis revealed that the plastic viscosity and yield stress of mortars with 1 wt{\%} MCC were increased by 20.9{\%} and 190.0{\%}, respectively, compared with those of mortars without MCC. The buildability of mortars with 1 wt{\%} MCC was also improved, and the printed structure exhibited neither large cracks among the printed filaments nor distorted components in the printing process. Compared with the mortars without MCC, the 28-d compressive and flexural strengths of the mortars with 1 wt{\%} MCC were increased by 18.6{\%} and 12.5{\%}, respectively. In addition, the carbon emissions from the overall life cycle of a printed residence were quantified by considering the material attributes of additive manufacturing and using software tools to conduct building information modeling (BIM)-enabled life cycle assessment (LCA) modeling. The results indicated that compared with the mortars without MCC at equivalent mechanical strengths, the mortars containing 1 wt{\%} MCC could reduce the CO2 emissions by 6.82{\%}. The comprehensive improvement in rheological properties and buildability as well as the environmental benefits can promote the sustainable industrial utilization of MCC-reinforced cement-based materials in the 3D-printing industry. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Thus, this sector has been object of actions aiming the promotion of low carbon construction and refurbishment given its potential to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by applying more sustainable materials and techniques. With the development of the building information modeling (BIM) methodology, it is possible to develop the different project specialities in an integrated and collaborative platform since its initial phase, also facilitating the integration of life cycle assessment (LCA). The present work aims to evaluate and compare the environmental impacts of prefabricated concrete elements of new construction and solutions of seismic reinforcement of these elements in an existing building, as well as their costs, through LCA methodology and life cycle cost (LCC). For this purpose, the BIM model of an industrial building with a prefabricated concrete structure was developed and the respective LCA was achieved. It was considered the model of a similar building with 30 years of existence, whose structural calculation not considered the correct strengthening to face seismic actions. The respective seismic reinforcement solution was analyzed, and the corresponding LCA was accomplished. For each case, the LCC was calculated. The analysis of the two buildings highlighted the importance of rehabilitation in the construction sector, since the environmental impacts and the associated costs are reduced when compared to the construction of a new building. {\textcopyright} 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract = {A review of the existing literature suggests that intrusions on sites are often overlooked as current construction safety assessment methods are primarily focused on visible consequences such as injuries and deaths. Moreover, traditional Behavior-Based Safety (BBS) methods for improving worker attitude towards adopting safety practices on work sites are not adequate as these methods do not provide quick feedback for changing unsafe worker behaviors in real-time to avoid fatalities. Consequently, geo-localization systems are used for acquiring spatio-temporal trajectories to identify unsafe worker behaviors on construction sites. However, spatio-temporal trajectories lack contextual building or site information. For incorporating the geographical and application-specific context in trajectories, semantic enrichment processes are executed. The semantic enrichment process should include changing contextual information related to the evolving building objects over time. The changing contextual information of building objects is required to be tracked by a system to study the worker behaviors in a dynamic building environment context. After reviewing the existing literature, it is concluded that none of the present systems offer a mechanism to identify unsafe worker behaviors such as intrusions in dynamic environments where the contextual information of building spaces evolves over time in terms of location, size, properties and relationships with the environment. To fill this research gap, a system is proposed; First, to acquire the worker movements using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons. Second, to perform the pre-processing as well as semantically enriching the spatio-temporal worker trajectories using relevant updated contextual information of a building. Lastly, to visualize the building locations where intrusions have occurred using Building Information Modeling (BIM) approach. The developed system presents an integration of systems from the data acquisition stage to visualizing the unsafe work behaviors that could serve as a foundation for future research in studying advanced movement-related worker behaviors in dynamic environments by overcoming the spatio-temporal data management challenges. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

An existing townhouse inWashington, DC was chosen as the research target to study how to retrofit or reconstruct the design of a building according to the NZEB concept. The methodology of this research is modeling an existing townhouse to assess the current situation and creating optional models for improving energy efficiency of the townhouse in Revit and utilising renewable energy technology for energy supply. This residential building was modeled in three versions to compare changes in energy performance including improving thermal efficiency of building envelope, increasing thickness of the wall, and installing smart windows (switchable windows). These solutions can reduce energy and cost by approximately 8.16{\%}, 10.16{\%}, and 14.65{\%}, respectively, compared to the original townhouse. Two renewable energy technologies that were considered in this research were photovoltaic and wind systems. The methods can be applied to reconstruct other existing buildings in the future. {\textcopyright} 2019 by the authors.},

In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of the secretome released from the adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) transfected with PGC-1$\alpha$ (PGC-secretome). We first generated PGC-1$\alpha$-overexpressing ASCs by transfecting ASCs with the plasmids harboring the gene encoding PGC-1$\alpha$. Secretory materials released from PGC-1$\alpha$-overexpressing ASCs were collected and their therapeutic potential was determined using in vitro (thioacetamide (TAA)-treated AML12 cells) and in vivo (70{\%} partial hepatectomized mice) models of liver injury. In the TAA-treated AML12 cells, the PGC-secretome significantly increased cell viability, promoted expression of proliferation-related markers, such as PCNA and p-STAT, and significantly reduced the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In the mice, PGC-secretome injections significantly increased liver tissue expression of proliferation-related markers more than normal secretome injections did (p {\textless} 0.05). We demonstrated that the PGC-secretome does not only have higher antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, but also has the potential of significantly enhancing liver regeneration in both in vivo and in vitro models of liver injury. Thus, reinforcing the mitochondrial antioxidant potential by transfecting ASCs with PGC-1$\alpha$ could be one of the effective strategies to enhance the therapeutic potential of ASCs. {\textcopyright} 2019 by the authors.

abstract = {Today high-performance buildings are equipped with sophisticated monitoring systems and sensors for collecting large amounts of data related to the buildings' indoor environmental quality and energy consumption. To visualize, interpret, and utilize the collected data, facility managers and decision-makers typically use text or spreadsheets, which make it difficult to understand and track the real-time building's performance. Building information modeling (BIM) is a process of developing a virtual equivalent of the actual building that supports data exchange, management and communication during the whole building's life cycle. However, the BIM model cannot show real-time information related to the performance of the building in the operational stage. This paper presents three approaches for integration of the building sensor technology and the BIM process to enable visualization and analysis of real-time and historical readings: (i) Sensor-Revit integration; (ii) Sensor-Revit-Navisworks integration; and (iii) Sensor-Revit-Navisworks-API integration. The comparison between the potential value-adding functions of each approach and the associated limitations is discussed. Furthermore, this is the first work to utilize widely-known and popular Autodesk Navisworks software for development of a user-friendly add-in program to enable real-time and historic data characterization and analysis. The overarching aim of this paper is to improve the efficiency of facility management (FM) and utilize BIM data accessible during building's lifecycle. The university engineering building equipped with a monitoring system for tracking and collecting various building-related parameters is used for demonstration of the developed software technologies. This study demonstrates how BIM-sensor integration can lead to more responsive building management and operation by making sensor data tangible and accessible for property managers, owners, and occupants. {\textcopyright} 2019 The author(s).

abstract = {Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing (MEP) models are generally characterized by information redundancy and a high density of irregularly shaped components. Consequently, they require large storage spaces and are not conducive for interchange purposes. Geometric optimization of MEP models can play a significant role in facilitating model exchange and handover by increasing storage, transmission and display efficiency. To date, the body of knowledge on such geometric optimization, unfortunately, is still very narrow. This paper presents and tests a solution for the optimization of storage, transmission, and display of MEP models. Storage optimization was achieved through a mapping-based model description method and a novel Quadric-Error-Metric (QEM) mesh simplification algorithm, reducing required storage while maintaining the contour of components. For transmission optimization, a normal vector compression algorithm and a fixed-dictionary specific compression algorithm were proposed to achieve efficient compression of data thus, fulfilling the need for cross-platform interchange. Display optimization was obtained through a normal vector regeneration algorithm for clustering triangle meshes to improve 3D display effects. The evaluation of the solution, performed for each individual component separately as well as for an entire solution, proved successful. Volume of storage data was reduced by 40{\%} to 50{\%} through mesh simplification. Data transmission volume was reduced by more than 80{\%} for components with complicated geometry without affecting the topology of the components. Finally, the display process was capable of decreasing the number of triangles and delivering very good quality of displayed models. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

Therefore, this study presents a method with a theoretical case study to examine the improvement of energy efficiency in a typical high-rise residential building through window retrofitting. A building energy design model in Designbuilder along with a building information modeling (BIM) model in Revit are developed, with 20 common potential glazing alternatives being analyzed to predict the potential energy savings in the same case building with identical orientation located in a variety of climate zones in China. Based on different parameters and considerations, the results demonstrated that the currently relatively expensive low-e window glazing has the best energy performance in all climate zones, but is sufficiently close to conventionally glazed windows in its energy efficiency to discourage its adoption at present, and that, instead, a single dark conventional glazed window is preferred in a hot summer/warm winter climate, double dark traditional glazing in a hot summer/cold winter climate, and a double clear conventional window in a cold climate. Based on the simulated results, an indicative suggestion was provided to select an adequate window system for residential building retrofitting in the studied climates or similar climatic regions. {\textcopyright} 2019 by the authors.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction techniques are increasingly used to obtain 3D representations of buildings due to the broad range of applications for 3D city models related to sustainability, efficiency and resilience (i.e., energy demand estimation, estimation of the propagation of noise in an urban environment, routing and accessibility, flood or seismic damage assessment). With advancements in airborne laser scanning (ALS), 3D modeling of urban topography has increased its potential to automatize extraction of the characteristics of individual buildings. In 3D building modeling from light detection and ranging (LIDAR) point clouds, one major challenging issue is how to efficiently and accurately segment building regions and extract rooftop features. This study aims to present an investigation and critical comparison of two different fully automatic roof segmentation approaches for 3D building reconstruction. In particular, the paper presents and compares a cluster-based roof segmentation approach that uses (a) a fuzzy c-means clustering method refined through a density clustering and connectivity analysis, and (b) a region growing segmentation approach combined with random sample consensus (RANSAC) method. In addition, a robust 2.5D dual contouring method is utilized to deliver watertight 3D building modeling from the results of each proposed segmentation approach. The benchmark LIDAR point clouds and related reference data (generated by stereo plotting) of 58 buildings over downtown Toronto (Canada), made available to the scientific community by the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS), have been used to evaluate the quality of the two proposed segmentation approaches by analysing the geometrical accuracy of the roof polygons. Moreover, the results of both approaches have been evaluated under different operating conditions against the real measurements (based on archive documentation and celerimetric surveys realized by a total station system) of a complex building located in the historical center of Matera (UNESCO world heritage site in southern Italy) that has been manually reconstructed in 3D via traditional Building Information Modeling (BIM) technique. The results demonstrate that both methods reach good performance metrics in terms of geometry accuracy. However, approach (b), based on region growing segmentation, exhibited slightly better performance but required greater computational time than the clustering-based approach. {\textcopyright} 2019 by the authors.

abstract = {Buildings are one of the largest energy consumers in the world, and have great energy saving potential. Thermal systems and lighting systems take most of the energy in a building. Comparing with the optimization solutions developed for a thermal system, the research of improving the lighting system is insufficient. This study aims to improve the lighting environment and reduce the energy by optimizing the building design, which has the largest potential for cutting energy economically compared with the other stages in the life cycle of a building. Although many approaches have been developed for building design optimization, there is still one big problem obstructing their successful practices, in that the designers who take the responsibility of making building designs are not experts in building physics, thus they are not capable of calculating the most appropriate parameters and operating the professional software to optimize their designs. Therefore, this study proposes a user-friendly method for designers to improve building designs. Firstly, Building Information Modeling (BIM) and particle swarm optimization algorithm are applied to build an intelligent optimal design search system. The optimized design from this system can largely use daylighting for internal illumination and save energy. Secondly, different types of lighting control systems are compared and the one which can save maximal energy is added to the selected optimal design. A case study demonstrates that optimized designs generated by the proposed design method can save large amounts of life cycle energy and costs, and is effective and efficient. {\textcopyright} 2019 by the authors.},

abstract = {Streetscape elements are the major contributors to the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon in the built urban environment. The hot surface air in this phenomenon is concentrated in urban regions and will gradually decrease in surrounding temperatures in suburban or rural regions. The effect of UHI can be seen through the increasing of land surface temperature and influencing the urban ecological systems, climates, and environments. A study has been conducted to identify the impact of urban heat island surrounding the PMU's streetscape furniture. In this study, the UHI variation has been investigated using BEM and city scale model. The UHI obtained were analyzed and modeled using satellite imagery and GIS. The 3D models of the PMU's fa{\c{c}}ade were also been developed by using a laser scanner and thermal camera. Based on the analyses, the existing condition of seven selected PMUs are very high for Bangsar, High for Abu Bakar Baginda, Jalan Meru and Batu 4 Kuantan, Medium-high for Kuantan North and Taman Jaya and medium for Setia Alam. Land Surface Temperature (LST) in PMU facade is ranging between 23 {\textordmasculine}C to55{\textordmasculine}C. Building information modeling (BIM) analysis shows that the existing material used in most PMU facades with solar reflectance was uniformly low to medium-low. Building information modelling (BIM) result shows the building will give greater heat flux (+42{\%} to +53{\%} at 3 pm) because of the solar reflectance ({\%}) from the facades of surrounding streetscape material used. By obtaining the information regarding the elements and factors that contribute to the UHI phenomenon within the study area, the reduction of heat absorption can be performed. {\textcopyright}BEIESP.},

Moreover, the cloud-based BIM model enables project team members to access the project information from anywhere by using mobile devices. The proposed system was tested on a real PC project to validate its effectiveness. The results indicate that the sensor network can provide reliable data via LoRa technology, and a PC component can be accurately located on site.

abstract = {Electricity dependent heating-cooling (H/C) system has increased rapidly to provide thermal comfort to the occupants. H/C is a major source of energy consumption in residential buildings around the world. Studies revealed that the thermal properties of building materials are converted into the same unit as thermal resistance (R) in the USA, Canada, The UK, Australia, and other countries. However, none of the previous studies have considered the adaptation of national insulation codes to reduce electricity cost and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions with the correlations of energy consumption (Q) to thermal resistances (R) of the building envelop (A). Therefore, this study attempts to review the optimum energy consumption of a selected house due to H/C at different choices of national code standardized R values. Accurate envelop areas (A) of the selected house components are estimated by applying the Autodesk Revit Building Information Model (BIM) to use in the energy model. The case study critically evaluates the variation of electricity cost, GHG emissions, and selection of the optimized thermostat settings for energy savings in different climatic regions and seasons of a year. Different correlations are obtained using risk analysis software on energy consumptions with code recognized arrays of insulations. This sensitivity analysis result shows that the corelation coefficient of energy consumption with medium-low insulated building envelop (r = 0.44) is more significant than improved, maximum, medium-high, and minimum insulations (r = 0.14–0.29) which indicates the insulation range where more emphasis should be put to get an optimized solution. Thus the developed analytical framework supports inclusive decision-making by selecting appropriate kinds of insulation for the design of a sustainable house. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Existing studies reveal that unsafe worker movement behaviors are one of the major reasons of construction site fatalities resulting in serious collisions with site objects and machinery. For understanding worker movements in dynamic construction environments which involve moving and changing objects, a system named ‘WoTAS' (Worker Trajectory Analysis System) is proposed. First, a real-time Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons-based data collection and trajectory pre-processing subsystem is built for extracting multifaceted trajectory characteristics and stay regions of the workers that will help in recognizing the important regions in the building for categorizing the worker movements. Second, to enable the desired semantic insights for better understanding the underlying meaningful worker movements using the contextual data repositories related to the building environment, an ontology-based ‘STriDE' (Semantic Trajectories for Dynamic Environments) model is applied which tracks the evolution of moving and changing building objects and outputs semantic trajectories. For extracting insights from the semantic trajectories, the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is used which is one of the probabilistic approaches present in the literature for describing the object behavior in time. Using the HMMs, a set of trajectories belonging to a stay region is analyzed by categorizing the worker movements into four different states. In the end, the output of the Viterbi algorithm is visualized using a BIM model for identifying the most probable high-risk locations involving sharp worker movements and rotations. The developed ‘WoTAS' system will help safety managers in monitoring and controlling building activities remotely in dynamic environments by understanding the worker movements for improved safety management in day-to-day building operations. Eventually, understanding the worker movements will contribute towards reducing the chances of near-miss incidents on sites which have the potential to cause serious accidents. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper studies the impact of using different types of energy storages integrated with a heat pump for energy efficiency in radiant-floor buildings. In particular, the performance of the building energy resources management system is improved through the application of distributed model predictive control (DMPC) to better anticipate the effects of disturbances and real-time pricing together with following the modular structure of the system under control. To this end, the load side and heating system are decoupled through a three-element mixing valve, which enforces a fixed water flow rate in the building pipelines. Hence, the building temperature control is executed by a linear model predictive control, which in turn is able to exchange the building information with the heating system controller. On the contrary, there is a variable action of the mixing valve, which enforces a variable circulated water flow rate within the tank. In this case, the optimization problem is more complex than in literature due to the variable circulation water flow rate within the tank layers, which gives rise to a nonlinear model. Therefore, an adaptive linear model predictive control is designed for the heating system to deal with the system nonlinearity trough a successive linearization method around the current operating point. A battery is also installed as a further storage, in addition to the thermal energy storage, in order to have the option between the charging and discharging of both storages based on the electricity price tariff and the building and thermal energy storage inertia. A qualitative comparative analysis has been also carried out with a rule-based heuristic logic and a centralized model predictive control (CMPC) algorithm. Finally, the proposed control algorithm has been experimentally validated in a well-equipped smart grid research laboratory belonging to the ERIGrid Research Infrastructure, funded by European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme. {\textcopyright} 2019 by ASME.},

It faces great challenges to meet the goal of transforming the existing building stocks into near zero-energy buildings by 2050. The development of Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) schemes in the EU provides a powerful and comprehensive information tool to quantitatively predict annual energy demand from the building stock, creating a demand-driven market for energy-effective buildings. Properties with improved energy rating have had a positive impact on property investments and rental return because of the reduced energy bills. In addition, the EPC databases have been applied to energy planning and building renovations. However, it should be mentioned that the current evaluation system faces problems, such as not being fully implemented, delivering low quality and insufficient information to stimulate renovation, therefore requiring improvements to be made. This paper provides a review of the current EPC situations in the EU and discusses the direction of future improvements. The next generation EPC should rely on BIM technology, benefit from big data techniques and use building smart-readiness indicators to create a more reliable, affordable, comprehensive and customer-tailored instrument, which could better represent energy efficiency, together with occupants' perceived comfort, and air quality. Improved EPC schemes are expected to play an active role in monitoring building performance, future energy planning and quantifying building renovation rates, promoting energy conservation and sustainability. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Purpose: Buildings and their use is a complex process from design to occupation. Buildings produce huge volumes of data such as building information modelling (BIM), sensor (e.g. from building management systems), occupant and building maintenance data. These data can be spread across multiple disconnected systems in numerous formats, making their combined analysis difficult. The purpose of this paper is to bring these sources of data together, to provide a more complete account of a building and, consequently, a more comprehensive basis for understanding and managing its performance. Design/methodology/approach: Building data from a sample of newly constructed housing units were analysed, several properties were identified for the study and sensors deployed. A sensor agnostic platform for visualising real-time building performance data was developed. Findings: Data sources from both sensor data and qualitative questionnaire were analysed and a matrix of elements affecting building performance in areas such as energy use, comfort use, integration with technology was presented. In addition, a prototype sensor visualisation platform was designed to connect in-use performance data to BIM. Originality/value: This work presents initial findings from a post occupancy evaluation utilising sensor data. The work attempts to address the issues of BIM in-use scenarios for housing sector. A prototype was developed which can be fully developed and replicated to wider housing projects. The findings can better address how indoor thermal comfort parameters can be used to improve housing stock and even address elements such as machine learning for better buildings. {\textcopyright} 2019, Kay Rogage, Adrian Clear, Zaid Alwan, Tom Lawrence and Graham Kelly.},

abstract = {Energy consumption in buildings is a very important issue, where the operational demand is considered to be one of the highest amongst all other sectors of an economy. Moving towards energy efficient buildings is a key factor to achieve sustainability. A novel framework for integrating mathematical optimization, Building Information Modeling, and Life Cycle Assessment to enhance the operating energy efficiency of the resulting building designs adopted, along with reducing the difficulties associated with the construction of the building, in terms of cost of construction, is developed. The framework accommodates various parameters, via integrating mathematical optimization programming, Building Information Modeling, and Life Cycle Assessment to improve the building performance, identify alternative sustainable designs, and empower the decision-making process and sustainability in the construction sector. Through the developed optimization model, the examination of various alternatives for building components that make up the envelope of a residential building is undertaken. Insights gained from the results show that all components of building envelopes influence the energy consumption in buildings, particularly, exterior walls and windows. Impacts in terms of annual energy use intensity can be reduced by about 45{\%}, life cycle energy use and cost can be enhanced by more than 50{\%}, and environmental impacts such as acidification and global warming potential can be reduced by more than 30{\%}, due to use of the proposed framework. This work indicates that sustainable building decisions can be achieved by optimizing the material selection and assessment of environmental impact via Building Information Modeling and life cycle assessment. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the transfer of information from the building information modelling (BIM) models to either conventional or advanced asset management platforms using Linked Data. To achieve this aim, a process for generating Linked Data in the asset management context and its integration with BIM data is presented. Design/methodology/approach: The research design employs a participatory action research (PAR) approach. The PAR approach utilized two qualitative data collection methods, namely; focus group and interviews to identify and evaluate the required standards for the mapping of different domains. Also prototyping which is an approach of Software Development Methodology is utilized to develop the ontologies and Linked Data. Findings: The proposed process offers a comprehensive description of the required standards and classifications in construction domain, related vocabularies and object-oriented links to ensure the effective data integration between different domains. Also the proposed process demonstrates the different stages, tools, best practices and guidelines to develop Linked Data, armed with a comprehensive use case Linked Data generation about building assets that consume energy. Originality/value: The Linked Data generation and publications in the domain of AECO is still in its infancy and it also needs methodological guidelines to support its evolution towards maturity in its processes and applications. This research concentrates on the Linked Data applications with BIM to link across domains where few studies have been conducted. {\textcopyright} 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {Building Information Models (BIMs)are valuable facility management tools, however the resources required to develop existing building BIMs are a recognized barrier to adoption of facility management enabled BIMs. Significant developments have been made for generating geometrically complex models using scanning technologies, however the resultant models are often extremely large and require significant computational resources. This paper presents an automated process that uses 2D floorplans and elevation drawings to generate semantically-rich BIMs with adequate geometry for energy simulation and integration of the significant diversity and volume of data necessary for day-to-day building operations and facility management. The proposed approach minimizes the resources necessary for both model creation and maintenance, limiting initial BIM creation to match the level of detail available on available building drawings, while providing the flexibility to incorporate complex geometry at a future date. Two case studies, a set of university campus buildings and a healthcare training facility, have been modelled using this approach and the resultant model generation speed, accuracy, and resultant quality are discussed, along with limitations and future process improvements. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {With the rapid adoption of building information modeling (BIM) across diverse industries, the need for a universal standard for BIM data exchanges has become critical for the success of BIM applications. Questions of the level of development and interoperability of BIM as methods to exchange data and integrate various model-based applications into an efficient work process have come to the forefront of BIM standardization to improve the design and construction of facilities. Current BIM software authoring tools center on conventional structural systems and are not yet adequate for modeling floating structures. Hydro-supported structures comprise a special type of structure that relies primarily on the hydraulic buoyancy of the supporting water body to maintain equilibrium and safety. It is an area that is increasingly drawing the attention of architects and engineers to resolve many issues in coastal areas and to deal with issues related to increased flooding and tropical storms, such as shoreline stabilization, hurricane response, alternative energy, and rainwater collection and utilization. The study centers on expanding BIM standardization for designing and analyzing floating and amphibious structures. It seeks to address the information delivery manual (IDM) and model view definitions (MVDs) as they provide the basis for data exchange specifications for the industry foundation classes (IFC) schema. This research aims to enable a proficient BIM workflow for designing hydro-supported structures characterized by the coherent, organized, and reproducible exchange of consistent data that is commonly recognized across the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. {\textcopyright} 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

At present, the research on individual thermal comfort does not consider its implementation mode. Moreover, the improvement of energy saving efficiency under the premise of increasing human comfort is an urgent problem that needs to be solved. In this paper, we proposed a Building Information Model (BIM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based system to solve this problem. The system consists of two parts including an ANN predictive model considering the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) index, the persons' position, and an innovative plugin of BIM to realize dynamic evaluation and energy efficient design. The ANN model has three layers, considering three environment parameters (air temperature, air humidity, and wind speed around the person), three human state parameters (human metabolism rate, clothing thermal resistance, and the body position) and four body parameters (gender, age, height, and weight) as inputs. The plugin provides two functions. One is to provide corresponding personal thermal comfort evaluation results with dynamic changes of parameters returned byWireless Sensor Networks (WSN). The other one is to provide energy saving optimization suggestions for interior space design by simulating the energy consumption index of different design schemes. In the data test, the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the established ANN model was about 0.39, while the MSE of traditional PMV model was about 2.1. The system realized the integration of thermal information and a building model, thereby providing guidance for the creation of a comfortable and green indoor environment. {\textcopyright} 2019 by the authors.},

abstract = {Energy efficient buildings require envelopes designed to fit the local and the climate zone while the greatest benefit of opaque ventilated fa{\c{c}}ades is the ability to reduce cooling thermal loads. The natural convection in the air chambers and the protection against solar incidence provided by the external layer reduces the energy consumed by the artificial systems used for environmental conditioning (HVAC systems). This research investigates the energy benefit of opaque ventilated fa{\c{c}}ades compared to cladding fa{\c{c}}ades in multi-floor residential buildings located in nine climate zones, according to the K{\"{o}}eppen-Geiger classification, in Brazil. To this end, computational simulations using software from the same company, capable of automatically synchronizing the modeling data and energy analysis of a whole year were used. Also, the cost of implementing the system in different locations was determined in order to analyze the cost-benefit of the system against the yearly energy benefits. The greatest energy benefits, as well as the best cost-benefits, were found in the hottest regions, demonstrating that this system is relevant for the climate conditions in Brazil and its use should be encouraged since the largest area of the country is located in hot climate zones. Despite the similar results found for cities in the same climate regions, there were also significant differences among them so an individual analysis taking into account the influence of wind speed and rainfall should be performed as well. The study evaluated a wide sampling, 16 cities from all climatic zones, unlike the current studies that were conducted between 2010 and 2018 in Europe, having as main contribution the analysis of an entire building over the period of one year, becoming the most complete research to date, conducted with great speed enabled by the adopted computer simulation methods. This research shows that the behavior of ventilated fa{\c{c}}ade is an improvement in terms of passive cooling of the building compared to cladding facades, offering energy electric savings up to 43{\%} yearly, in the hottest cities. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {To investigate the dynamical properties of the novel hybrid compound, lithium benzimidazolate-borohydride Li2(bIm)BH4 (where bIm denotes a benzimidazolate anion, C7N2H5 -), we have used a set of complementary techniques: neutron powder diffraction, ab initio density functional theory calculations, neutron vibrational spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, neutron spin echo, and quasi-elastic neutron scattering. Our measurements performed over the temperature range from 1.5 to 385 K have revealed the exceptionally fast low-temperature reorientational motion of BH4 - anions. This motion is facilitated by the unusual coordination of tetrahedral BH4 - anions in Li2(bIm)BH4: each anion has one of its H atoms anchored within a nearly square hollow formed by four coplanar Li+ cations, while the remaining -BH3 fragment extends into a relatively open space, being only loosely coordinated to other atoms. As a result, the energy barriers for reorientations of this fragment around the anchored B-H bond axis are very small, and at low temperatures, this motion can be described as rotational tunneling. The tunnel splitting derived from the neutron spin echo measurements at 3.6 K is 0.43(2) $\mu$eV. With increasing temperature, we have observed a gradual transition from the regime of low-temperature quantum dynamics to the regime of classical thermally activated jump reorientations. The jump rate of the uniaxial 3-fold reorientations reaches 5 × 1011 s-1 at 80 K. Nearer room temperature and above, both nuclear magnetic resonance and quasi-elastic neutron scattering measurements have revealed the second process of BH4 - reorientations characterized by the activation energy of 261 meV. This process is several orders of magnitude slower than the uniaxial 3-fold reorientations; the corresponding jump rate reaches ∼7 × 108 s-1 at 300 K. {\textcopyright} 2019 American Chemical Society.},

Consequently, a database is developed to collect the raw data in seven typical cities in China.

abstract = {In recent years, off-site construction has been significantly hyped as a viable solution for improving the sustainability of the construction industry. There is yet an approach to be developed that can utilise project-specific parameters to quantify the improvement in adopting off-site methods as opposed to conventional construction. This paper focuses specifically on modular construction as an off-site production system, where a decision support tool is proposed for contrasting conventional and modular construction methods based on selected sustainability criteria. The framework relies on quantifying certain measures of: i) social factors, including safety and noise pollution; ii) environmental factors, such as energy consumption, U-value of the building envelope and embodied energy; and iii) economic factors including time and cost of construction. Fuzzy logic, equivalent noise summation and algorithmic mapping are utilised to quantify the sustainable measures adopted. The indices utilised to showcase the possible comparison that can be made between construction methods, are up to the decision maker to decide upon. Realistic case studies, involving the construction of a granny flat and a school are used to demonstrate the applicability of the developed framework. The modular construction method was found to perform on average 21{\%}, 52{\%} and 60{\%} better in terms of the measures adopted for social, environmental and economic costs in contrast with the conventional approach, for the cases considered. {\textcopyright} 2019},

Encoded on the latch are functional motifs for binding, degradation or nuclear export that function only when the key displaces the latch from the cage. We describe orthogonal cage–key systems that function in vitro, in yeast and in mammalian cells with up to 40-fold activation of function by key. The ability to design switchable protein functions that are controlled by induced conformational change is a milestone for de novo protein design, and opens up new avenues for synthetic biology and cell engineering. {\textcopyright} 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.},

abstract = {Due to increasing dependence of our modern life on automated household equipment, higher energy demand has posed significant burden on electricity consumption in major housing models. A large number of old houses and apartment buildings in major cities are energy-deficient, leading to significant overloading of the existing nuclear power plants. Secondary consequences such as increase in electricity unit rate are also financially affecting the owners of the buildings. In this paper, it is proposed to develop newer strategies to identify critical variables contributing to energy efficiency and design more energy-efficient housing architectures. The need to reduce global warming and achieve near-zero-energy building leads to the development of new research idea where multicomponent energy assessment of the buildings can be performed by changing various parameters such as orientation and surroundings of a house, materials and other internal and external configurations. It is proposed to use Building Information Modeling (BIM) to virtually model a house and evaluate its energy performance. Changes of internal and external configurations of a structure can impact annualized maintenance budget of residential houses and other public infrastructure such as walk-in clinics, shopping complexes or office buildings. Various case studies are conducted which enable the building owners to better understand the practical aspects of designing green buildings, thereby leading to significant cost-savings and strengthen the quality of life in major cities. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

The purpose of this paper is to solve the quantitative measurement problem by a metric system. Using Multiple Criteria Analysis, this metric system aims to measure BIM influences in BEM, especially of existing housings.

This study performs a bibliometric study analysis of BIM publications based on the Scopus database during the whole period from 2003 to 2018. The aim was to establish a comparison of bibliometric maps of the building information model and BIM in universities. The analyzed data included 4307 records produced by a total of 10,636 distinct authors from 314 institutions. Engineering and computer science were found to be the main scientific fields involved in BIM research. Architectural design are the central theme keywords, followed by information theory and construction industry. The final stage of the study focuses on the detection of clusters in which global research in this field is grouped. The main clusters found were those related to the BIM cycle, including construction management, documentation and analysis, architecture and design, construction/fabrication, and operation and maintenance (related to energy or sustainability). However, the clusters of the last phases such as demolition and renovation are not present, which indicates that this field suntil needs to be further developed and researched. With regard to the evolution of research, it has been observed how information technologies have been integrated over the entire spectrum of internet of things (IoT). A final key factor in the implementation of the BIM is its inclusion in the curriculum of technical careers related to areas of construction such as civil engineering or architecture. {\textcopyright} 2019 by the authors.},

abstract = {Over the past few years, Green and Sustainable Buildings have gained a lot of prominence owing to the growing environmental concerns. Buildings have acquired a significant share in the overall energy usage and have also become a major source of CO2 emissions throughout its lifecycle. Construction of Green Buildings by incorporating various sustainable design parameters may be a tedious process, but integrating Building Information Modeling (BIM) in the design can make the procedure much simpler. In this study, the building performance of a Green Office Building is assessed in terms of sustainability using BIM. Similarly, performance analysis is carried out for a conventional building to explore the ecological advantages of erecting a Green Building. The analysis gave about 15{\%} energy savings, 22.3{\%} water usage savings and 21{\%} carbon reductions in the Green Building compared to the Conventional Building. Also, an alternative for the Green Building Design is evaluated which showed 4.7{\%} Energy Cost Savings and about 38.6{\%} Reduction in CO2 emissions compared to the original design. So,with this method, different alternatives for the design are easily generated in the conceptual phase itself and therefore, decisions regarding the design are made easily. But this technique generates results which mainly focuses on the operation phase of a building with least attention given to material production and transportation stage. Also, there are chances of errors due to file transfer in different formats while carrying out the analysis in BIM. {\textcopyright} 2019, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

abstract = {Building green retrofit is considered as an effective means of energy saving and achieving sustainable development goals. The success of a building retrofit is highly dependent on the retrofit strategies used. However, it remains challenging to select appropriate retrofit strategies for a specific retrofit building. There are numerous cases of building retrofit around the world, which can be collected, stored, and analysed. The knowledge gained from these cases could provide a useful reference for making decisions on new retrofitting projects. This study presents a case-based reasoning (CBR) approach to support building green retrofit decisions. A total of 71 retrofit cases in China were collected. The attributes of the retrofitting buildings were identified, including the general building information, component information, and energy and cost information. A synthetic optimisation weighting method was adopted based on both expert opinion and the attribute characteristics. A real retrofit case located in Shanghai was used as a case study to demonstrate the application of the CBR approach. The results indicate that the CBR approach can aid in identifying similar cases from the case database, and extracting valuable information from these. The experience and lessons learned from past cases can guide decision makers in making improved decisions on new green retrofit projects. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Residential buildings are the significant energy consumer of the India which is about 24{\%} of the total energy consumption. Energy efficient buildings are the ideal solution to reduce energy consumption in the building sector. The energy efficient buildings can be achieved by incorporating passive features or renewable energy systems or both. The current work aims to perform a retrofitting analysis of an existing building into an energy efficient building. For performing the energy analysis REVIT 2017 tool is used. Using the REVIT 2017 tool building model is developed, building information are loaded and energy analyses are performed. The building is analyzed as two cases. The first case is to estimate energy performance of the existing building. The second case is to incorporate passive features and renewable energy system to the building and evaluate the energy performance. Existing building Energy Usage Intensity (EUI) was 193 kWh/m2 /year. When passive features (Insulation, additional window glazing and efficient air conditioning systems) alone incorporated to the building the building EUI is reduced to 138 kWh/m2 /year. Along with Passive features Photovoltaic modules with different efficiencies 16{\%}, 18{\%} and 20{\%} are considered for renewable energy generation. The energy generation for the different PV modules for three different roof area (40{\%}, 60{\%} and 70{\%} of total roof area) is evaluated. The energy usage intensity varies from 11.4 from-150 kWh/m2 /year for the combination of different efficiency of PV module and the different {\%} of roof area covered. The negative sign indicates the energy generation after the required energy usage. The payback period for only incorporating passive features is 6.3 years and while incorporating PV system with passive features is 9 years. {\textcopyright} BEIESP.},

The risk score (RS) for each possible route is evaluated as a weighted summation of risk level index values of all risk factors for all segments along the route, and the route with the lowest RS is recommended to the evacuee. The system will automatically re-evaluate all routes every 2 s based on the most updated information, and the evacuee will be notified if a new and safer route becomes available.

The ability to import data from BIM and BEMS provides the potential to significantly reduce the time and effort needed for the continuous calibration of BES models. First, five gbXML geometric test cases were used to check the BIM to BES model translation. Translation of the test cases indicates good geometric agreement between the native BIM and the gbXML-based BES model. An actual building calibration case study (with BIM and three years of monthly electrical energy consumption data) was then used to evaluate the proposed continuous calibration method. The results suggest that compared to a non-continuous approach, the continuous Bayesian calibration method showed reduced prediction uncertainty and improved prediction accuracy on a test dataset. The paper also presents information and comparison of the coefficient of variance of the root mean square error (CVRMSE) and the normalized mean biased error (NMBE), recommending looking at their distributions when working with probabilistic BES predictions. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The automatic transformation of a Building Information Model (BIM) in Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) to a building energy model (BEM) demonstrates significant benefits on the improvement of efficiency and accuracy in a building energy modeling process. However, so far, building objects with curved surfaces in IFC models are not supported by existing transformation approaches as they only handle polyhedral geometries. This study presents an algorithm to automatically facet curved walls and convert their geometries into polyhedrons, so that they can be further processed by existing transformation approaches. In the process of faceting curved walls, geometric connections between each target wall and adjacent walls are detected and handled to maintain the connections in the results. Furthermore, the algorithm updates the geometries of relevant building objects, including straight walls connected to curved walls, openings (i.e., windows and doors) on curved walls and spaces enclosed by curved walls, based on the faceted geometries. This removes curved surfaces of these objects on the one hand, and maintains their geometric relationships on the other. Moreover, slabs with the curved surfaces are also faceted. This algorithm takes an IFC BIM that pertains to the model view definition Concept Design BIM 2010 as an input. It generates a new IFC BIM, in which all curved walls and relevant building objects are represented as polyhedral geometries with correct geometric relationships. A prototype application that implements the algorithm was developed to evaluate the performance of the algorithm with a simple building model and a complex real-world building model. In the results, all the curved walls were faceted, and all relevant straight walls, openings, spaces and slabs were correctly updated, which indicated that the algorithm worked as intended. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {At present, sustainable design is experiencing energy consumption and cost-effectiveness challenges in the building industry. A recent body of literature argues that the development of emerging smart digital technologies, such as Building Information Management (BIM) and blockchain (BC), offer immediate benefits to the industry. However, the current application of BIM and BC in the sustainable design and construction process focuses on smart energy and construction management, with little attention to addressing challenges for applying BIM to sustainable design and proposing strategies in terms of the usability of these technologies in the management of building construction projects. Therefore, this paper sets out to explore the potential roles of an integrated BIM and BC approach for sustainable building design information management. The first attempt is presented to use BC aided BIM for sustainable building design coordination and collaboration in multiple building stages. BC has the potential to address challenges that hinder the industry from using BIM for sustainable design, which has been unearthed. An innovative BC enhanced transaction process in BIM is required for sustainable building development. Roles of a user level driven smart contract system of BC can be used to enhance BIM system in the sustainable buildings process. The role of BC is primarily at user level driven smart contracts and their record value exchange capabilities. A user level (BIM stakeholders) driven BC technology for transaction in BIM process flow is revealed, and the user level (sustainable building design project stakeholders/BIM clients) driven and the smart contract enabled BIM+ BC architecture to address challenges of BIM for sustainable design has been further circulated according to the literature. Subsequently, a conceptual architecture of BIM + BC for Sustainable Building Design Information Management Framework in building project management has been proposed, validated, and refined. The Framework has two level encompassing structures and flow. The high-level framework is focused on strategy, whilst the low-level framework demonstrates technical components in detail. This architecture supporting project stakeholders in managing information, has the potential to achieve and ensure the realization of sustainable design goals through the interactive realization of smart contracts integrated into the user level driven BIM + BC system and its recording value exchange function through three user-driven levels, namely user, system, and transaction. {\textcopyright} 2019 by the authors.

The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) suggested that Building Information Modelling (BIM) should be used to achieve sustainability requirements during refurbishment projects as a correspondence to the National Audit Office (NAO) sustainability report. BIM is now widely advocated as the preferred tool for the management and co-ordination of design and construction data using object- oriented principles. The successful integration of environmental assessment into BIM for the whole of the construction lifecycle has not yet been achieved. The potential for using BIM in refurbishment projects specifically for achieving and managing sustainability requirements has not been yet critically reviewed or put into practice. This paper focuses on the use of BIM sustainability design tools in refurbishment projects, to achieve energy efficient buildings and achieve sustainability criteria for refurbishing non-domestic buildings. A critical lens is cast on the current literature in the domains of sustainable designs and the associated implications of the sustainability decision-support tools in BIM. The research also reviews the practicality of the existing sustainability decision-support tools that are currently used to assist with achieving environmental scheme certifications such as BREEAM and LEED for refurbishment projects. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Building energy systems, i.e. heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, are essential for modern buildings. They provide a comfortable and healthy indoor environment. Design quality has significant impact on HVAC system efficiency. The typical building energy system design process involving several procedures is repetitive and time-consuming. It is often limited by the engineer's experience, capabilities, and time constraints; thus, the design in most cases barely satisfies building codes. In recent decades, computational intelligence (CI) has achieved substantial improvements in various fields. This paper presents a comprehensive review of using CI for HVAC system optimization design. Firstly, this paper analyzes seven procedures which constitute a typical HAVC system design process and finds that optimization problems encountered during design process can be divided into three categories: model estimation, decision making and uncertainty analysis. Then a brief introduction of CI techniques used to solve HVAC design optimization problems and detailed literature review of application examples are given. Though the design problem varies with each other, this paper outlines a typical workflow which is able to solve most HVAC optimization design problems. At last, a framework of an integrated HVAC automation and optimization design tool is proposed. The framework is developed based on building information modeling (BIM) and extracted typical design optimization workflow. It is able to connect various design stages by implementing structured information transfer between them and ultimately improve design efficiency and quality. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Building information modelling (BIM) and geographical information systems (GIS) provide digital representation of architectural and environmental entities. BIM focuses on micro-level representation of buildings themselves, and GIS provide macro-level representation of the external environments of buildings. Moreover, their combination can establish a comprehensive view of a built environment based on data integrated, which underpins the development and transition of the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industries in the digital era. This paper gives a comprehensive review on BIM-GIS integration in sustainable built environments in order to analyse the status quo and practical applications from four viewpoints: technologies for data integration, applications in the life cycle of AEC projects, building energy management, and urban governance. Three typical modes of BIM-GIS integration, namely, “BIM leads and GIS supports” “GIS leads and BIM supports” and “BIM and GIS are equally involved” are categorised based on the different dominant positions of the two technologies. Furthermore, the research trends and future directions for the applications of BIM-GIS integration are discussed. Specifically, we underline that semantic models and third-party integration platforms should be optimised technically, and information about the whole process of AEC projects needs to be improved. Comprehensive information for building energy management should be digitised and quantified to improve its systematic integration and application to the urban built environment. This review can serve as a roadmap for researchers who focus on studies of BIM-GIS integration in the sustainable built environment. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The buildings' sector accounts for a large share of energy consumption on a global scale. This scenario generates the need to design and construct more efficient buildings and also requires new policies and incentives. The greatest opportunities for integrating energy efficiency strategies in construction occur at the design stage, in which decisions that will have significant impacts on the building's life cycle are taken. Therefore, the use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) is considered, as well as parametric design: New design technologies that allow the analysis of multiple scenarios to support the decisions during the design stage. The purpose of this study is to provide, through a literature analysis, an overview about practical applications of BIM and parametric design for buildings' energy efficiency in a recent research scenario. Studies were categorized according to their main approach and the main software used. In addition, benefits provided by the use of the technologies adopted were highlighted. {\textcopyright} 2019, Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Apartment buildings are the most common housing typology in South Korea. The mass construction of apartment neighborhoods during a period of rapid economic growth (1970-1997) involved the minimization of material use and quality, as well as industrialized construction processes. Accordingly, apartment buildings require essential renovation after only 20 years of operation. This study focuses on the improvement of thermal comfort for the renovation of an exemplary apartment building based on an integrated Building Information Modeling (BIM) and parametric software framework. The existing apartment was reconstructed with BIM software, and the virtual model was utilized for a parametric building energy simulation to calculate the thermal comfort condition of occupants during the entire year. The thermal comfort analysis results defined the criteria for the development of an enhanced building envelope system characterized by modular panels. The parametric energy simulation was executed for the renovated apartment condition with the enhanced envelope system, and the thermal comfort improvements were quantified by comparing the results for the apartment condition before and after renovation. This study aims to provide the tools and criteria for the comfort analysis of apartment occupants, as well as propose sustainable solutions for the improvement of thermal comfort in aged buildings with similar conditions, internal distribution, and construction components. {\textcopyright} 2019 by the authors.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the reasons for the dissatisfaction of the Iraqi people with the privatization of electricity due to the significant increase in electricity bills. It examines the main factors that affect the energy demand in the Iraqi houses for cooling and heating by modeling and analyzing existing buildings using Building Information Modeling (BIM). The results of energy consumption from BIM were compared with real consumption of the houses which was obtained from the bills to investigate the reality of the results. The simulation results were well-matched with the real data. Then three buildings were modeled and analyzed with alternative materials for roofs and walls by considering the cost of construction (CC), life cycle energy cost (LCEC) and carbon emission (CE) for each alternative. The best alternative is selected according to the opinion of the occupants, which was achieved by a questionnaire and the data obtained from the BIM models. The questionnaire data and the simulation results were analyzed by using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique. The obtained results were represented in a framework for selecting the best materials for constructing walls and roofs. For walls, it was found that rock block is the best since the final weight from AHP results was 0.5371, and Autoclaved Aerated Concrete Block (AAC block) rib slab is the best for roof with a final weight equal to 0.4218. The final model has LCEC of five times less than the original unit, but CC were equal and CE was decreased from 5 ton/year to less than 0.8 ton/year in the suggested alternative. {\textcopyright} 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Large costs for repairs can be reduced by applying measures to avoid moisture problems in indoor environments. The evaluation was performed over three stages, indicative, investigative and diagnostic. The process was mapped and the data stored using BIM standards so it can be used by stakeholders to take further actions. In the indicative stage, data was collected through questionnaires and surveys, and a quick evaluation was conducted of the affected units. In the investigative stage, an analysis of the entire building complex was conducted through simulation and tested against the building energy standards. In the diagnostic stage, in-situ and laboratory measurements were made and used for calculations. The results show that many factors were involved in the moisture damage, whose main causes were overcrowded spaces, inadequate thermal regulation for the local climate, poor apartment and complex design, and flaws and inconsistencies in the quality of construction. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Therefore, new processes based on exploiting the potential of existing and new tools are required. In this framework, the OptEEmAL project has developed a tool that integrates stakeholders, data and tools in order to ease the process of designing energy efficient retrofitting projects at building and district scale. This tool works around an optimisation framework in order to evaluate, compare and optimise candidate retrofitting scenarios against a set of indicators showing the performance of the district. This evaluation and optimisation method is based on aggregating indicators through transforming the priorities of stakeholders into a mathematical weighting scheme, which makes it possible to provide scenarios within their expectations. Therefore, the generation of these scenarios is driven by their design parameters, being thus flexible and adapted to their needs. This paper shows the implementation of this tool and specifically 3 different prioritisation schemes, analysing how they impact into the decision making process and selection of the retrofitting strategy. {\textcopyright} 2019 by the authors.},

abstract = {Despite the relevance of building information modelling for simulating building performance at various life cycle stages, Its use for assessing the end-of-life impacts is not a common practice. Even though the global sustainability and circular economy agendas require that buildings must have minimal impact on the environment across the entire lifecycle. In this study therefore, a disassembly and deconstruction analytics system is developed to provide buildings' end-of-life performance assessment from the design stage. The system architecture builds on the existing building information modelling capabilities in managing building design and construction process. The architecture is made up of four different layers namely (i) Data storage layer, (ii) Semantic layer, (iii) Analytics and functional models layer and (iv) Application layer. The four layers are logically connected to function as a single system. Three key functionalities of the disassembly and deconstruction analytics system namely (i) Building Whole Life Performance Analytics (ii) Building Element Deconstruction Analytics and (iii) Design for Deconstruction Advisor are implemented as plug-in in Revit 2017. Three scenarios of a case study building design were used to test and evaluate the performance of the system. The results show that building information modelling software capabilities can be extended to provide a platform for assessing the performance of building designs in respect of the circular economy principle of keeping the embodied energy of materials perpetually in an economy. The disassembly and deconstruction analytics system would ensure that buildings are designed with design for disassembly and deconstruction principles that guarantee efficient materials recovery in mind. The disassembly and deconstruction analytics tool could also serve as a decision support platform that government and planners can use to evaluate the level of compliance of building designs to circular economy and sustainability requirements. {\textcopyright} 2019},

abstract = {Building design involves many challenges and requires to take into account the interaction between the building and the users. Different occupant behaviour models implemented with building simulation tools (thermal, air quality, lighting) have been proposed. Among these, models based on the agent approach seem to be the most promising. However, existing models poorly describe human cognition and the social dimension. Moreover, they are often oriented towards a specific use (thermal simulation, waste management) without being transposable to another field, and they require a significant instantiation effort for each new case, making their use difficult. This article proposes an agent-based model called Li-BIM that simulates the behaviour of the occupants in a building and their indoor comfort. Li-BIM model is structured around the numerical modelling of the building –BIM- (with standard exchange format IFC), a high-resolution cognitive model, and the coupling with various physical models. Li-BIM simulates the reactive, deliberative and social behaviour of occupants in residential dwellings based on the Belief–Desire–Intention architecture. This model, thanks its ease of use and flexibility, is an operational and relevant tool to support building design process with a human-centred approach. An application of the model is presented, focusing on energy consumption and the inhabitants' comfort. In-situ data obtained from the instrumented house that served as case study have been compared with simulation results from Li-BIM and a standard energy simulation software, demonstrating the reliability of the proposed model. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {The construction industry is facing many challenges including low productivity, poor regulation and compliance, lack of adequate collaboration and information sharing, and poor payment practices. Advances in distributed ledger technologies (DLT), also referred to as Blockchain, are increasingly investigated as one of the constituents in the digital transformation of the construction industry and its response to these challenges. The overarching aim of this study was to analyse the current state of DLT in the built environment and the construction sector with a view to developing a coherent approach to support its adoption specifically in the construction industry. Three objectives were established to achieve this: (a) to present the first state-of-the-art and literature review on DLT in the built environment and construction industry providing a consolidated view of the applications explored and potential use cases that could support disruption of the construction industry. Seven use-categories were identified: [1] Smart Energy, [2] Smart Cities {\&} the Sharing Economy, [3] Smart Government, [4] Smart Homes, [5] Intelligent Transport, [6] BIM and Construction Management, and [7] Business Models and Organisational Structures; (b) to propose a framework for implementation composed of two conceptual models (i.e. the DLT Four-Dimensional Model, and the DLT Actors Model), developed according to extended socio-technical systems theory and including four dimensions (technical, social, process and policy), to support the development of DLT-based solutions that are adequate to the challenges faced by the construction industry. The DLT Four-Dimensional Model and the DLT Actors Model contribute to improve the understanding of the concepts involved when discussing DLT applications in construction and represent flexible, adaptable and scalable knowledge constructs and foundations that can be used for various further investigations; and (c) to appraise three specific use cases (i.e. Project Bank Accounts, regulation and compliance, and a single shared-access BIM model) as potential areas for DLT through the application of a decision support tool. The results show that Project Bank Accounts (PBAs) and regulation and compliance are candidate areas for DLT applications and warrant further attention. However, for the third use case (i.e. single shared-access BIM model) DLT are still insufficiently developed at this time. The research shows that there is real potential for DLT to support digitalisation in the construction industry and enable solutions to many of its challenges. However, there needs to be further investigation of the readiness of the industry, its organisations and processes, and to evaluate what changes need to occur before implementation can be successful. Further investigations will include the development of a roadmap process incorporating the four dimensions to evaluate readiness across a series of use cases for the construction industry. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The gap between the architectural information and the as-is building condition has been known as one of the pivotal factors influencing deviations between actual and predicted building energy consumption. Despite such significance, quantifying the impact of deviated building information on energy use has not been fully investigated. This paper explores building information modelling (BIM)-driven experimental simulation to quantify the impact of building envelope condition on energy use, which can infer the impact of reflecting the as-is building conditions in as-designed BIMs on the reliability of energy analysis. First, BIM-driven energy simulations are conducted with varied thermo-physical properties of building envelope elements in gbXML-based BIMs under different climate conditions. Building upon the impacting factor for energy analysis (IFEA), the simulation results are then used to infer the impact of the deviated building condition on energy consumption. Through case studies, it is observed that the annual energy consumption of a residential building can deviate by 18–20{\%}, whereas thermal resistances of exterior walls can deviate by 1 m2K/W. This paper validates quantitatively the potential benefits of reflecting the as-is building condition in BIM-based energy performance analysis. This provides practitioners with insights into how to improve the reliability of energy analysis of existing buildings. {\textcopyright} 2018, {\textcopyright} 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\&} Francis Group.},

abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to describe how building information model (BIM) and big data can be combined in the same interface for providing new value to stakeholders, such as the property owner and user, as well as property service and workplace service companies. The research presents a new concept, which shows how the BIM can be exploited efficiently during maintenance. Design/methodology/approach: Initially, existing facility management (FM) processes were investigated to find out how to digitize them and identify bottlenecks. Second, BIM's data content was explored to identify the information that could be used to streamline FM processes. Third, the potential of the active data measured in the building was evaluated. Finally, research was undertaken to find out how constantly fluctuating information can be combined with BIM objects and what kind of added value that combination could offer. The literature review was used to support the primary contribution. In addition, the research problems were described and the basics of the research were obtained by interviews. The author has interviewed 27 professionals from several stakeholders. Findings: The first finding is that the BIM can serve as a platform for building use, various services and management when it has been adequately generated during the planning and construction phases and enriched before being commissioned. The other essential finding is the theory of conditions data model (CDM), which is a technical environment that combines active data with BIM. The most important advantages of BIM in FM are as follows: • Building owner attains better user satisfaction, acquires better quality and smarter services, saves energy, ensures better indoor conditions and improves building profitability. • Service providers can develop and offer new services, speed up operations, save resources and generate more profits. • The occupant gets a better user experience, faster and higher quality services and better indoor conditions. Research limitations/implications: The CDM enables to generate for the real estate and construction (RE{\&}C) sector a novel BIM-based ecosystem with standard rules, instead of every individual operator developing his/her own unique solution for BIM use in FM. This will have an impact on the entire RE{\&}C sector's operating methods and will have significant financial implications in the near future. Application of this research is limited to office buildings where indoor condition measuring is undertaken continuously and where the knowledge of the use cases of spaces is available. In addition, the proper BIM in the Industry Foundation Classes format must exist. The evaluation of the validity of big data is not discussed in this article. Visualization of data and content of user interfaces will be the topic of another article by the author. This article does not deal with intricate technical details, but crucial issues are defined. Originality/value: The article presents a unique method for BIM use in FM. The theory of CDM (how to combine active data with BIM) is completely new and a similar solution has not been presented earlier. The theory of the presented method will be the crucial key for BIM use and will lead worldwide commissioning. Currently, the theory is under test in the practical pilot project. The results of the project will be published in the next article. {\textcopyright} 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This review includes an overview of the BIM-BEM process and recent technological developments, while elaborating on the main research gap.

abstract = {The use of energy efficiency procedures is a typical practice in building construction process that creates a huge amount of data regarding the building. This is particularly valid in structures which include complex collaborations, for example, ventilation, sunlight-based increases, inner additions, and warm mass. This paper proposes a new approach for automating building construction when improving their energy efficiency, aiming to foresee comfort levels based on Heating, Ventilating, Air Conditioning (HVAC), constructive systems performance, environmental conditions, and occupant behavior. More specifically, it presents a research work about thermal performance of prefabricated construction systems developed by an Argentine enterprise called Astori, using two Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) processes to extract knowledge. In this context, Building Information Modeling (BIM) will give data to support the calculation to outline goal levels of a sustainable building performance concerning classification systems. The data were collected from a project in Uruguay referring to the construction systems and the energy efficiency of the building. The data mining tool SPMF was used to test the performance of classification and its use in prediction. Particularly, FP-Growth Algorithm and Clustering methodologies were used to analyze a combination of ambient conditions, in order to compare them using Revit{\textcopyright} software. The results generated by these methods can be generalized for a set of buildings, according to the objective to be achieved concerning the thermal building performance. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The UK government made significant commitments to upgrading the energy efficiency of seven million British homes by 2020, aiming at reducing carbon emissions and addressing fuel poverty. One alternative to achieve better energy performance in existing houses is retrofit. However, there are difficulties associated with retrofitting social housing. It is currently challenging to compare scenarios (retrofit options) considering costs, potential energy efficiency gains, and at the same time minimising disruption to users. This paper presents a Building Information Modelling (BIM) protocol aimed to support decision making by social housing owners. It adopts BIM to simulate alternative retrofit options, considering: (a) potential reductions in energy consumption, (b) 4D BIM for retrofit planning and reduction of users' disruption and (c) simulation of costs. A what-if scenario matrix is proposed to support decision making in the selection of social housing retrofit solutions, according to client and users' needs. A case study of the retrofit of a mid-terrace house is presented to demonstrate the workflow. The main output of the work is the BIM protocol, which can support client decision making in diverse social housing retrofit projects, considering all three elements (energy simulation, planning for reduced disruption and cost estimation) in an integrated fashion. Such an integrated approach enables clients to make better informed decisions considering diverse social housing retrofit options through a simple process using readily available BIM technology. {\textcopyright} 2019 by the authors.},

Nowadays, BEM and supervision are the most important challenges of smart cities, and BIM has a good and useful source of information for buildings. Recent innovations have provided the opportunity for construction industry to invest in state-of-the-art technologies and adopt new processes. Among these new methodologies is BIM, which has developed for the construction industry over the last two decades. Integrating graphical and non-graphical information, it enables construction industry stakeholders to work collaboratively for efficient project delivery throughout the life cycle of construction projects. The use of BEM in construction industry has come about to respond to the global call for energy conservation and sustainability. BEM tools and processes can be used to simulate energy performance, evaluate energy needs and optimize architectural design. This article reviews and classifies BEM applications into eight different categories such as prediction, estimation, consumption, optimal design, evaluation, efficiency, management, and optimization. In addition to examination of BEM in different categories and according to BIM that is a coordination model and includes all information in construction industry as well as electrical, mechanical, and architectural information, this review paper wants to know how many articles have used BIM such as a database in this industry. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {European Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry consumes a significant amount of materials like steel, aluminum, copper and plastics, thus creating a large reservoir on secondary raw materials in buildings. One of the main strategies to minimize environmental impacts and the energy consumption is maximizing recycling rates. To enable circularity, and in consequence high recycling rates, material information about the existing building stock is necessary. Therefore, new design-centric tools and methods, as well as tools, which enable a compilation of data repositories on the material composition of buildings, are required. The first aim of this research is the generation of a Building Information Modelling (BIM) - supported Material Passport (MP), which enables an assessment of the recycling potential and environmental impacts of building materials. For the compilation of the semi-automated MP, a specific methodology was developed and tested on a use case. Thereby various challenges regarding data and stakeholders were faced, such as inconsistent data and lack of collaboration between various stakeholders. These challenges lead to the second focus of this paper – the development of a data- and stakeholder management framework. The data- and stakeholder management framework presents the required collaboration of various stakeholders in order to achieve a successful implementation of the MP in the AEC industry. Results show, that a semi-automated compilation of the BIM-based MP is possible and the implementation of the MP in the AEC industry requires close collaboration of a broad spectrum of stakeholders, thus forming a need for creating digital platforms for life cycle management of buildings and material resources. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Due to poor quality construction materials and components, the average operative life of apartment buildings is 20 years. The rapid degradation and low maintenance condition of transparent and semi-opaque components, as well as the limited daylight access in the standard apartment layout, are cause for the lower visual comfort of occupants. This research analyzes the improvement in visual comfort for the renovation of an exemplary apartment unit in Seoul, using Building Information Modeling (BIM) and parametric environmental analysis tools. The existing apartment is virtually reconstructed with BIM software. The building model is exported to Computer-Aided Design software to execute parametric daylight analyses through environmental simulation software. An enhanced modular building envelope and apartment layout are developed to reduce the energy demand for heating, cooling, artificial lighting, and to improve visual and thermal comfort. The visual comfort analysis of the refurbished apartment results in average improvements of 15{\%} in terms of Daylight Factor and 30{\%} of daylight autonomy. Therefore, this research proposes, the renovation of aged Korean apartment buildings to enhance daylighting and visual comfort. {\textcopyright} 2019 by the authors.},

In this study, we analyzed the adaptability of the Global Positioning System/BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (GPS/BDS) BIMs and ionospheric total electron content (TEC) anomalies over China during 12 X-class and M-class large solar flare events during the solar active period in terms of the TEC, rate of TEC (ROT), and relative accuracy. Our study showed that during the solar flare occurrence the GPS-derived TEC over China may increase up to 5.0 TECUs within minutes, whereas the ROT may exceed 0.5 TECU/min. Relative to the GPS-derived TEC and ROT, both BDS and GPS BIMs cannot response so actively to these solar flares. However, in terms of relative accuracy, the BDS BIM performed with weaker influence from solar flares due to its updating of coefficients with high frequency, though the absolute accuracy of the BDS BIM has to be improved further. {\textcopyright} 2019 COSPAR},

This study proposes a framework based on various performance parameters to enable decision-makers utilizing standard procedures and software to empower the process of sustainable energy use and management in buildings, through a parametric analysis in different climatic conditions. Experimental design is adopted within the framework via the use of various performance parameters related to the building design (i.e., construction materials for exterior walls and roofs, as well as a set of window-to-wall ratios). Results indicate that climate data plays a fundamental role in the choice of design factors that are best suited for effective energy consumption in buildings. In particular, sub-type climate classifications, as opposed to the primary climate group, have a minor influence. Around 15{\%} improvement in the energy consumption in buildings is noticed due to changes to the design factor such as the window-to-wall ratio. Insights that can be gleaned from this study include the impact of space area, exterior openings and material thickness and choice for the envelope of the building in all climate classifications, aiding in the design of low-energy buildings. {\textcopyright} 2019 by the authors.},

This framework integrates Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation, multi-zone-air-flow modelling, and Building Energy Simulation (BES) to calculate ventilation rates under the mechanisms of wind-, buoyancy- and wind and buoyancy-driven ventilation. The framework was applied to a 40-storey residential building in Hong Kong for estimating the potential of natural ventilation in residential high-rise buildings. The results show that the building can save up to 25{\%} of the electricity consumption if the building employs wind-driven natural ventilation instead of mechanical ventilation. The electricity consumption can be further reduced up to 45{\%} by facilitating the buoyancy-driven natural ventilation. However, natural ventilation is found to be effective only if the temperature difference between indoor and outdoor is less than 2 °C. The study suggests to orienting residential high-rise buildings at an oblique angle with the prevalent wind direction than positioning perpendicular to the prevalent wind direction. Furthermore, the framework recommends promoting the wind-driven natural ventilation at top floors of residential high-rise buildings and to facilitate wind and buoyancy-driven natural ventilation at middle and lower floors of the buildings. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {The design of a building is a collaborative process among experts from multiple disciplines. Using Building Information Modeling (BIM), a model is developed through multiple refinement stages to satisfy various design and engineering requirements. Such refinements of geometric and semantic information are described as levels of development (LOD). Thus far, there is no method to explicitly define an LOD's requirements nor to precisely specify the uncertainties involved. Furthermore, despite the insufficient information in the early design stages, a BIM model appears precise and certain, which can lead to false assumptions and model evaluations, for example, in the case of energy efficiency calculations or structural analyses. Hence, this paper presents a multi-LOD meta-model to explicitly describe an LOD's requirements, incorporating the potential fuzziness of both, geometric and semantic information of individual elements. The explicitly defined fuzziness can be taken into account when applying simulations or analyses for assessing the performance of different building design variants. To support the continuous elaboration of a building from the conceptual to the detailed design stages, the multi-LOD model makes it possible to ensure the consistency of the geometric and semantic information as well as the topological coherence across the different LODs. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated by its prototypical implementation as a web-server and user-interface, providing a means for managing and checking the exchange requirements both at the meta-level and for concrete building model instances. The paper is concluded with a case study of a real-world construction project that demonstrates the use of the meta-model to support model analysis and the decision-making process. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {The Energy Performance of Building Directive obligated all European countries to reduce the energy requirements of buildings while simultaneously improving indoor environment quality. Any such improvements not only enhance the health of the occupants and their productivity, but also provide further economic benefits at the national level. Accomplishing this task requires a method that allows building professionals to resolve conflicts between visual and thermal comfort, energy demands, and life-cycle costs. To overcome these conflicts, this study exploits the incorporation of building information modelling (BIM), the design of experiments as an optimization algorithm, and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) into a multi-criteria decision-making method. Any such incorporation can (i) create constructive communication between building professionals, such as architects, engineers, and energy experts; (ii) allow the analysis of the performance of multiple construction solutions with respect to visual and thermal comfort, energy demand, and life-cycle costs; and (iii) help to select a trade-off solution, thereby making a suitable decision. Three types of energy-efficient windows, and five types of ground floors, roofs, and external wall constructions were considered as optimization variables. The incorporation of several methods allowed the analysis of the performance of 375 construction solutions based on a combination of optimization variables, and helped to select a trade-off solution. The results showed the strength of incorporation for analyzing big-data through the intelligent use of BIM and a simulation in the field of the built environment, energy, and costs. However, when applying AHP, the results are strongly contingent on pairwise comparisons. {\textcopyright} 2019 by the authors.},

abstract = {Over the years, the construction industry has been evolving to embrace the delicate balance between buildings and a sustainable environment by optimizing resource use to create greener and more energy efficient constructions. Sustainable building design and optimization is a highly iterative and complicated process. This is mainly attributed to the complex interaction between the different heterogenous but heuristic construction processes, building systems and workflows involved in achieving this goal. Augmented Reality (AR) has rapidly emerged as a revolutionary technology that could play a key role towards improving coordination of sustainable design processes. AR makes possible the real-time visualization of a three-dimensional (3D) building prototype with linked design information in a real-world environment based on a two-dimensional drawing. From past research, it is evident that this technology relies heavily on a common data environment (CDE) that syncs all construction processes with their related building information in one central model. However, due to the fragmented nature of the construction industry, different domain experts generate and exchange vast amounts of heterogenous information using different software tools outside a CDE. This paper therefore investigates the performance gap that exists within Malaysia's construction industry towards using linked building data (LBD) with AR to improve the lifecycle sustainability of buildings. The results of this study clearly delineate how current construction practices in Malaysia do not favor the use of AR however, stakeholder perception is positive towards adoption of workflows that link heterogenous building data to streamline AR with sustainable building design and construction. {\textcopyright}BEIESP.},

abstract = {A large part of energy usage in buildings occurs during the operational phase, emphasising the need for efficient and improved facility management, operation and control. Model Predictive Control (MPC) or Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) are among the strategies that allow minimising energy use and costs during operation. However, the need for fast and accurate dynamic models (e.g. grey box model), which are time-consuming and challenging to implement, precludes their systematic integration in the built environment. A typical grey-box modelling approach consists of manually implementing several grey-box model structures with an increasing level of complexity before performing a forward selection procedure to identify the optimal configuration. The link between the different grey-box models and the monitored data is also established manually. Such an approach can be both time-consuming and error-prone and involves a significant cost that hampers the broad adoption of strategies such as MPC and FDD. This study proposes a tool-chain that uses BIM to automatically generate several grey-box structures with added complexities stemming from the specific geometry and design of the building. More specifically, an existing rule-based IFC to Modelica interface is extended to automatically create several Modelica-based grey box models that gradually take into account the building's specific information and characteristics. Additional rules are also proposed to automate the connection between the models and the building monitoring system. As a forward selection approach, a multi-objective optimisation using the NSGA-2 algorithm is adopted. The application of the tool-chain on two case studies shows that the integration of BIM to automate the implementation of grey box models, not only reduces the human involvement in the modelling process but can also produce more accurate models. Besides, this study shows that the use of multi-objective optimisation with datasets from two different seasons results in models that are valid for all seasons. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

Two buildings were analyzed using a three dimensional response spectrum analysis which is carried out using commercially available software called SAP 2000 V19 to study the effect of base isolation technique on building with rubber bearing isolator. The objective is to provide a retrofitting for the RCC building by comparing a fixed base model(FBM) with a base isolated model(BIM) using lead rubber bearing (LRB) isolator subjected to strong earthquakes in different seismic zones to attain an optimal design of the base isolated model. It is observed that, base isolation technique substantially increase the time period of structure and correspondingly reduce the base shear compared to FBM system. The roof displacements for an isolated base is decreased compare to the FBM system. {\textcopyright} BEIESP.},

abstract = {Purpose: Steel and reinforced concrete are among the most common structural materials used in the construction industry. Cost and the speed of construction have been usually the main criteria when selecting a building's structural system, whereby the environmental impact of the structural material is sometimes ignored. Availability of an easy-to-use tool for environmental assessment of the structural alternatives could encourage this evaluation in the decision making. The purpose of this paper is to introduce an automated tool for the environmental assessment of the on-site construction processes of a building structural system, which calculates the energy consumption and carbon emissions of the structural system as a parameter for comparison. Design/methodology/approach: This assessment tool is implemented using a building information modeling (BIM) platform to extract structural elements and their key attributes, such as type, geometrical and locational data. These data are processed together with a productivity database to calculate machine hours, and then predefined energy and carbon inventories are used to assess the energy consumption of the structural system in the erection/installation stage. Findings: This assessment tool provides an automated and easy-to-use approach to estimate energy consumption and carbon emissions of different structural systems that are modeled in a BIM platform. The results of this tool were within the ranges reported by the available studies. Originality/value: This research project presents a novel approach to use BIM-based attributes of the structural elements to calculate the required efforts, i.e. machine hours, and assess their energy consumption and carbon emissions during construction processes. {\textcopyright} 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The different strategies to improve interoperability are reviewed together with the various applications of such an integration (BIM with BEPS) in the literature. Firstly, a scientometric analysis which allows identifying research patterns and emerging trends in a specific research domain is performed to categorise the large number of articles constituting BIM literature into several clusters, each representing a particular topic. The main research topic in each cluster, together with the chronological progress and evolution of each cluster are summarized through a literature review of the selected highly cited articles. Secondly, an analysis of the different aspects relevant to the integration of BIM with BEPS is performed to highlight the evolution of the interoperability between BIM and energy simulation tools. Subsequently, a review of the different applications of such integration (BIM with BEPS) is performed to identify potential knowledge gaps. This study highlights six main BIM research topics focusing on BIM adoption and benefits, BIM-aided management, progress monitoring and as-built modelling, interoperability, life cycle analysis and energy simulation. It also emphasises the lack of well-established strategies to ensure the interoperability between BIM and energy simulation tools. Furthermore, this study reports on the poor integration of BIM and BEPS for building system and control modelling as well as its limited application during the operational phase. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {The benefits of implementing Building Information Modelling (BIM) tools in architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) have gained importance with the higher level of interdependence amongst design and analysis tools used by architects, engineers and project managers. Energy analysis has become more relevant during the early design phase in the AEC industry as these calculations are usually carried out at the end of the design process and do not give room for a variety of alternatives. Energy analysis needs to be incorporated in BIM to create alternative design options by the architects thereby predicting the usage of energy during the operational phase of a building. An architect requires optimising the operational energy need of a building at early design stage with limited parameters available and a simplified approach. This study identified the gap in a few selected and existing simulation tools and proposed a prototype model with minimum input variation to aid architects in estimating and optimising operational cooling energy during the early design phase. For achieving this model, the calibration of utilisation factors based on the impact of orientation on wall, window and floor area in monthly quasi-steady-state (QSS) of operational energy calculation was adapted in composite climate in an Indian context. {\textcopyright} 2019 The Association of Building Engineers.

abstract = {Building energy consumption prediction is becoming increasingly vital for energy management, equipment efficiency improvement, cooperation between building energy and power grid, and so on. But it is still a hard work to obtain accurate prediction results because of the complexity of the building energy behavior and the frequent undulations in the energy demand. In the building energy consumption prediction, the existing historical data are usually used to construct the traditional machine learning models and the deep learning models. However, compared with the data sets in the research domains of image recognition, speech processing and other fields, the data sets in the time series prediction of building energy consumption do not have a large quantity. Although the gray model can reduce the reliability on sufficient data, the model is difficult to develop, and it still needs detailed building information that may be lost in existing buildings. To overcome such issues, based on the parallel learning theory, we propose the parallel prediction scheme for the building energy consumption using Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN). The parallel prediction firstly makes use of a small number of the original data series to generate the parallel data via GAN, and then forms the mixed data set which includes the original data and the artificial data, and finally utilizes the mixed data to train the prediction models. To verify the proposed parallel prediction method, two experiments which adopts different kinds of data sets from two real-world buildings are conducted. In each experiment, the availability of the parallel data and the rationality of the parallel prediction model are evaluated, and detailed comparisons are made. Experimental results show that the parallel data have similar distributions to the original data, and the prediction models trained by the mixed data perform better than those trained only using the original data. Comparison results demonstrated that the proposed method performs best compared with the existing methods such as the information diffusion technology (IDT), the heuristic Mega-trend-diffusion (HMTD) method and the bootstrap method. The proposed parallel prediction scheme can also be extended to other time series forecasting problems, such as the electricity load forecasting, and the traffic flow prediction. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine how environmental design features of a green building contribute to the formation of employees' organization image (OIM) through better environmental awareness (EAW) within employees. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a comprehensive literature review on environmental design features of a building, a theoretical model was proposed for investigation. Three putative paths linking workspace (WSP) to EAW, departmental space (DSP) to EAW and EAW to OIM were then tested relying on a survey data of 362 employees collected from three Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certified buildings by using structural equation modeling methodology as prescribed by Hair et al. Findings: Significant evidence was found in support of all three purposed paths. Further, the study found that workspace and the DSP together explained around 46 percent of the variance in employee's EAW, which then explained around 54 percent of the variance in the formation of the employees' OIM. Research limitations/implications: The study drew data only from green certified organizations. Future research should involve other green organizations or a larger sample of green buildings. The size and character of the sample were restricted by organizational constraints. Practical implications: The organizations need to be extremely cautious of green concerns during the design phase in order to capitalize on the yields of better employees' OIM. It also motivates the other organizational group toward the green building concept to increase the employees' EAW and to enhance organizational values and image. Originality/value: While the green concept has been a significant research topic for more than decades, barely any research has been conducted that focuses specifically on environmental design features of a green building on employees' EAW and OIM. This study tries to make a link between green building design features with employees' EAW and OIM. These links are rare in Indian perspective. {\textcopyright} 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative design approach was used and triangulation of methods which included a focus group with the British Institute of Facilities Management (BIFM), semi-structured interviews with the case study Glasgow Life Burrell Renaissance Project who trialled the EIR and peer-reviews and interviews with BIM/CAFM experts from the BIM Academy and FM180. Findings: Specific guidance to help clients and facility managers prepare key BIM documents like the EIR are needed. They are aware of industry BIM standards and guidance but often not in detail. The Glasgow Life case study illustrated the EIR as a useful collaboration-tool to bring together stakeholders in early planning stages to understand client information needs.

Accordingly, this study provides the first comprehensive investigation into actual net-zero building construction costs in the United States, based on qualitative and quantitative research. The aims of this research are to: (1) provide a comprehensive survey of the existing body of literature to aggregate the findings and identify the consensus and pattern, (2) compare the results and analyze the evidence with a focus on quantitative studies, and (3) conduct a quantitative comparative analysis of twelve built zero energy buildings (ZEB) in order to understand whether there is enough evidence of cost differences between ZEB, conventional building (CB) and green building (GB). Statistical tests were performed, with the results showing no significant differences between actual ZEB costs and modeled CB costs. Further details investigated the cost difference between actual ZEB and modeled GB. The findings of this research provide initial detailed insights into net-zero building costs in the United States, which may benefit the promotion of ZEB practices. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Primary care centers are establishments with elevated social relevance and high operational energy consumption. In Chile, there more than 628 family healthcare centers (CESFAM) have been built in the last two decades and with plans for hundreds more in the next few years. We revised the architecture, construction management and energy performance of five CESFAM centers to determine possible instances of overall improvement. Staff was interviewed, and state documents reviewed, which allowed the conceptualization of the architectonic and energy structure of the centers, as well as the process of implementation. At the same time, energy simulations were done for each one of the centers, controlling for different climates, construction solutions and orientations. Our study revealed that strategies employed by the primary healthcare centers in Chile have aided a progressive implementation of establishments with elevated costs and materialization times, as well as neglect for climatic conditions. These energy evaluations show relevant and consistent impacts of the architectural form and material conditions, especially in southern zones, demonstrating the need to work with shared knowledge resources such as BIM. There is a clear necessity to define technological, morphological and construction strategies specific to each climate zone in order to achieve energetically efficient and intelligent healthcare establishments. {\textcopyright} 2019 by the authors.},

Reducing of consumption of energy without compromising thermal comfort may have environmental and financial benefits. Thermal comfort expresses satisfaction with the thermal environment is one of the parameters necessary in building style that in depth modeling and standardization exist. in commercial buildings if thermal comfort is not satisfactory that may effect on human life, which may cause problematic behavior that forms a heavy burden for skilled and informal careers day and night. The main energy consumption contribution within the operation section of contemporary buildings is from their HVAC systems. Tactically HVAC systems could offer healthy and comfortable indoor surroundings, whereas poor design could result in wastage of energy. Historically the look of the systems relies on a continuing range of occupants whereas the situational awareness of the system has been unnoticed. This paper focuses on the investigating of the HVAC system in terms of its information of the occupants of the power in real time. Thermal comfort analysis is applied to check the indoor climate of buildings for economical use of such HVAC systems.

abstract = {Virtual design tools and methods can aid in creating decision bases, but it is a challenge to balance all the trade-offs between different disciplines in building design. Optimization methods are at hand, but the question is how to connect and coordinate the updating of the domain models of each discipline and centralize the product definition into one source instead of having several unconnected product definitions. Building information modelling (BIM) features the idea of centralizing the product definition to a BIM-model and creating interoperability between models from different domains and previous research reports on different applications in a number of fields within construction. Recent research features BIM-based optimization, but there is still a question of knowing how to design a BIM-based process using neutral file formats to enable multidisciplinary optimization of life-cycle energy and cost. This paper proposes a framework for neutral BIM-based multidisciplinary optimization. The framework consists of (1) a centralized master model, from which different discipline-specific domain models are generated and evaluated; and (2) an optimization algorithm controlling the optimization loop. Based on the proposed framework, a prototype was developed and used in a case study of a Swedish multifamily residential building to test the framework's applicability in generating and optimizing multiple models based on the BIM-model. The prototype was developed to enhance the building's sustainability performance by optimizing the trade-off between the building's life-cycle energy (LCE) and life-cycle cost (LCC) when choosing material for the envelope. The results of the case study demonstrated the applicability of the framework and prototype in optimizing the trade-off between conflicting objectives, such as LCE and LCC, during the design process. {\textcopyright} 2019 by the authors.},

abstract = {Building Information modeling (BIM) has the potential to advance and transform facilities Operation and Maintenance (O{\&}M) by providing a platform for facility managers to retrieve, analyze, and process building information in a digitalized 3D environment. Currently, because of rapid developments in BIM, researchers and industry professionals need a state-of-the-art overview of BIM implementation and research in facility O{\&}M. This paper presents a review of recent publications on the topic. It aims to evaluate and summarize the current BIM-O{\&}M research and application developments from a facility manager's point of view, analyze research trends, and identify research gaps and promising future research directions. The scope of this research includes the academic articles, industry reports and guidelines pertaining to using BIM to improve selected facility O{\&}M activities, including maintenance and repair, emergency management, energy management, change/relocation management, and security. The content analysis results show that research on BIM for O{\&}M is still in its early stage and most of the current research has focused on energy management. We have identified that the interoperability in the BIM-O{\&}M context is still a challenge and adopting the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) Framework is a potential starting point to address this issue. More studies involving surveys are needed to understand the underlying O{\&}M principles for BIM implementation – data requirements, areas of inefficiencies, the process changes. In addition, more studies on the return on investment of the innovative systems are required to justify the value of BIM-O{\&}M applications and an improved Life Cycle Cost Analysis method is critical for such justifications. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

This study, therefore, investigates the effectiveness of applying passive cooling techniques using BIM and focuses on developing recommendations on feasible and optimized retrofitting techniques for existing buildings. Moreover, it gives an economic comparison between initial investment and returns based on the quantitative results of energy retrofitting. Thermal simulation software Autodesk Ecotect has been used to simulate annual energy consumption of one case building. Different passive cooling techniques have been applied according to Building Energy Codes of Pakistan. The input parameters are, thus, type of insulating material, the thickness of insulating materials, single and double glazing of windows and window to wall ratio. Results indicate that the annual energy consumption of selected building can be reduced up to 35 {\%} when building incorporates passive cooling techniques with a calculated payback period of 3 years and 2 months. {\textcopyright} 2019, International Journal Of Renewable Energy Research.},

abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) initially emerged as a capability to transfer information and allow interaction or interoperability of various software tools used for architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical design, and building construction. Its application from developing 3D models, structural analysis, cost estimation, and mechanical analysis has now expanded to other applications such as energy simulation. Multiple computer-aided design (CAD) tools work as BIM authoring tools to generate BIM files in different formats containing various types of building information. In addition, there are various building energy modeling (BEM) tools capable of importing these BIM files to perform energy simulation. However, such tools have various capabilities and limitations and need to be investigated and categorized in order to facilitate choosing a proper tool for design professionals in different phases of project and purposes. In addition, interoperability and data exchange issues between BIM and BEM tools should be understood in order to find solutions such as developing proper corrective middleware tools to rectify them. This paper reviews the challenges, issues, and shortcomings in BIM-to-BEM interoperability process (BBIP) by proposing a detailed classification for these issues and studying the available solutions. The paper also explains how a corrective middleware, which is developed by the authors using Python, can be utilized to modify a gbXML file prior to adoption in energy simulation to resolve the issues related to building envelope in BBIP. To do so, initially a review is presented on research studies focused on different types of BIM schemas such as IFC and gbXML and energy simulation tools capable of reading these files such as Green Building Studio (GBS), DesignBuilder, Integrated Environmental Solutions-Virtual Environment (IES), and OpenStudio. In addition, some of the challenges in the application of BIM for energy simulation such as interoperability issues, lack of standards, and lack of easy solutions for extending existing BIM schemas and available corresponding solutions are also reviewed. With the focus on building envelope in mind, three case studies are discussed to observe the challenges and issues with respect to BBIP using Revit, GBS, and OpenStudio. Moreover, these case studies provide an opportunity to investigate the application of corrective middleware tools similar to what is developed in the study presented. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

The authors apply the sociotechnical view of technology and the ramifications this view has on successful use of technology in design and construction. Design/methodology/approach: This is a discussion paper reviewing over a decade of research that connects three streams of research on architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) teams as these teams grappled with adapting work practices to new technologies and the opportunities these technologies promised. Findings: From studies of design and construction practices with building information modeling and energy modeling, the authors show that given the constructed nature of models and the loose coupling of project teams, these team organizational practices need to mirror the modeling requirements. Second, looking at distributed teams, whose interaction is mediated by technology, the authors argue that virtual world visualizations enhance discovery, while distributed AEC teams also need more traditional forms of 2D abstraction, sketching and gestures to support integrated design dialogue. Finally, in information exchange research, the authors found that models and data have their own logic and structure and, as such, require creativity and ingenuity to exchange data across systems. Taken together, these streams of research suggest that process innovation is brought about by people developing new practices. Originality/value: In this paper, the authors argue that technology alone does not change practice. People who modify practices with and through technology create process innovation. {\textcopyright} 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

As a result, the work process is not integrated and the work efficiency is reduced, such as the occurrence of redundant tasks. In this paper, the integrated process based on the BIM geometry information automated extraction module was presented and its effectiveness was reviewed and verified through self-developed automation module and uniformity and error-causing analysis. The construction of an integrated process through automatic configuration information extraction has the advantages of reducing the workload, enabling additional tasks through module function expansion, sharing information through the web, and ease of service manufacture. In addition, an experiment comparing the data of automatic and manual calculations with three subjects confirmed that automatic calculation database through automation module can produce a more reliable and uniform database with a lower proportion of human error than the manual calculation module. This not only improves the reliability of the energy simulation itself, but also reduces the human and temporal loads that occur during the post-simulation data verification process. {\textcopyright} 2019 by the authors.

abstract = {Climate change has driven energy conservation into buildings, pressuring engineers into developing newer energy efficient buildings and effectively retrofitting the older ones. This research presents a practical method of creating an energy model of a modern office building using a Building Information Modelling (BIM)–Infra-Red Thermography (IRT)–Heat Flux sensors (HFS) framework that ensures a high level of accuracy with relative ease. The energy model is created with little input of the HVAC system, simulating real-life lack-of-information scenarios, and subsequently verified with consumption data extracted from the building's own energy metre and the district's chiller plant it's connected to. The calibrated model is then used to investigate various passive heat-gain reduction measures through the building envelope such as the effect of the building's orientation, shading, insulation levels, and window performance. Limitations of conserving energy through the building envelope were highlighted through the law of diminishing returns and the SHGC was pointed out to be the single most effective thermophysical window property in conserving energy. Numerically, the replacement of the windows saved 1.6{\%} compared to the total 2.77{\%} of energy saved. The study focuses on the climate of the United Arab Emirates and furthermore evaluates some BIM interoperability challenges. {\textcopyright} 2019, {\textcopyright} 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\&} Francis Group.},

abstract = {The use of Building Information Modelling (BIM) is getting more and more popular since governments worldwide are increasing the demand of this methodology as a requirement in their projects. One of the most encouraging ways to promote the use of this methodology is based on the so-called BIM contests, where practitioners are challenged to build a virtual model of a structure collaboratively. These challenges are usually designed to take the participants out of their comfort zone and to encourage them to experiment in the use of the latest software and collaborative software connections. Unlike other activities encouraging BIM, these contests have the additional advantage of easing the comparison in terms of software, exchange file formats and information flows as all the proposals are framed into a common project with the same working time. Despite the interest of this kind of comparative analyses, no studies of the results of BIM contest proposals can be found in the literature. To fill this gap, this paper analyses the summary reports of the different proposals submitted in three editions (2014, 2015 and 2016) of the BIM Valladolid contest in Spain. The results of this study provide usefull insights into the use of software in a number of disciplines (Architecture, Structural Analysis, Energy Efficiency, Measurements and Budget, Facilities, Planning Execution and Coordination) and the most common file exchange formats. The evolution of teams in software use throughout the different contest editions as well as the information flow among the Architecture and the Structural Analysis disciplines are also analyzed. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Green envelope plays an important role to regulate the indoor environment for the temperate climate. However, in the case of hot and humid climate such as Malaysia, the benefits of having green envelopes need further quantitative investigations due to limited published literature. Incorporating green envelope during the design phase of an air-conditioned library could potentially improve its indoor thermal comfort, provide a pleasant indoor environment with reduced energy consumption. Hence, this study aims to analyse how green envelope options affect the Energy Usage Index (EUI) of a two-level library. This study employs a quantitative approach using Revit Building Information Modelling (BIM) simulation software. Variations in the building parameters simulated are building orientation, envelope material, thermal insulation, and envelope treatment. The study outcome indicates that various permutations of the green envelope presented various impacts on the EUI of the library. The double-glazed windows and green roof contributed a substantial improvement on the EUI indicated by the lowest mean EUI of 188 and 193 kWh/m2/year respectively compared with the control building that recorded a mean EUI of 226 kWh/m2/year. This study verifies the benefits of the green envelope as a strategy for energy efficiency. The credible results also support the application of building simulation to improve envelope design and to predict the possible outcomes of design alternatives before the building is constructed. {\textcopyright} 2019, Construction Research Institute of Malaysia.

abstract = {Inspection of sustainable performance during post-construction has become increasingly essential. However, conventional operation and maintenance processes are limited with a high probability of inaccurate manual building inspections and the lack of real-time input of dynamic factors. In this regard, engagement of an Integrated Knowledge-based Building Management System using nD BIM applications (nD BIM-IKBMS) is anticipated to promote promising resolutions. The proposed system is expected to provide simulation-based supervisory control while automatically detecting and diagnosing operational faults. Following the literature-based conceptual model developed in our past research, this study aims to generate and verify the proposed framework theoretically, as the second step of nD BIM-IKBMS research and development series, concentrating on functional modeling. Notwithstanding which, it is difficult to describe a cross-disciplinary system following a single framework. As the technology evolves, the framework can not be generalized into new scenarios. Towards this end, the study is followed through the complexity theory lens. A highly flexible framework, considering that each part wherein has an opportunity to evolve, was developed. Following the principles of axiomatic design, the proposed framework was established. Ultimately, this research generates a range of detailed 3-hierarchical Icam DEFinitions for Function Modeling 0 (IDEF0) diagrams outlining the proposed nD BIM-IKBMS structure. This study identifies the interoperability of the proposed framework by standardizing communication protocols, data formats, naming convention, evaluation systems, and modulization. While this research is limited to implementing our nD BIM-IKBMS framework, real-world projects will be utilized in our upcoming steps of R{\&}D series for validation purposes. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

Deviations between predicted and actual energy consumptions have however been reported as a major limiting factor to the tools adopted in the literature. A significant reason highlighted as greatly influencing the difference in energy performance is related to the occupant behaviour of the building. To enhance the effectiveness of building energy performance tools, this study proposes a method which integrates Building Information Modelling (BIM) with artificial neural network model for limiting the deviation between predicted and actual energy consumption rates. Through training a deep neural network for predicting occupant behaviour that reflects the actual performance of the building under examination, accurate BIM representations are produced which are validated via energy simulations. The proposed method is applied to a realistic case study, which highlights significant improvements when contrasted with a static simulation that does not account for changes in occupant behaviour. {\textcopyright} 2019 by the author.},

abstract = {Quality in architecture has become a topic of strategic importance in the construction sector and it holds an increasingly important place in regulations adopted by European countries. To meet the parameters set for architectural quality, sustainability and green buildings assessment tools are crucial, whether the project concerns the narrowest scale of a building or the largest scale of a city. Related to that, a large number of countries has issued energy certification procedures that rate the energy performance of buildings. The phase of conceptual design of a building is the most appropriate to integrate strategies meant to enhance sustainability. Implementing those strategies at the very beginning of the construction process, brings to cost reduction compared to doing so at a later stage. A wide range of green building assessment tools and protocols has been developed to improve the quality of the design process; their goal is to cut energy consumption and environmental impacts in both the construction and the management phases and thus abiding also to regulations. A large number of studies has been published regarding those assessment tools; they are usually divided into 2 main groups: a) based on a multi-criteria analysis, such as BREEAM, LEED, CASBEE b) based on the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach, such as BEES, BEAT, EcoQuantum. The growing use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) plays a key role in this realm. It allows the evaluation of multiple design scenarios at the same time from an environmental and financial points of view. This paper is focused on the possible integrating the green building assessment tools into BIM's software data systems. {\textcopyright} Dei Tipografia del Genio Civile. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Green building development creates many opportunities for meeting the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, most green buildings are new builds rather than retrofitted existing buildings. This may become an impediment for green development progress, as the issues of deforestation and land preservation remain unresolved. Green retrofitting of building facades is one of the most effective passive design strategies and permits perennial benefits for building energy performance, cost savings, and positive environmental impacts. There are a wide range of facade retrofit technologies readily available on the market at relatively low cost that require little installation time and yet can achieve similar energy performance levels as new green buildings. Notwithstanding these advantages, the uptake rates for these are moderately low. The challenges to widely implementing facade retrofitting of Malaysian office buildings are foreseen as holistic and include not just engineering and construction activities, but also social, economic, environmental, and governmental support. This paper aims to review the focus and direction of green development in the Malaysian construction industry and subsequently propose a research agenda for the rapid adoption of green facade retrofitting for local office buildings. The research agenda will commence with a survey on key factors that impede the uptake of green facade retrofitting, and then conducts energy simulations for contemporary green facade technologies (GFTs) using Building Information Modelling (BIM) software. It finally develops a decision-making tool for GFT selection based on simulated energy performance data and the key factors associated with building owners' considerations and expectations of facade retrofitting. The final research output is expected to act as a catalyst to spur green development progress by identifying the real issues faced by the prevailing construction industry. {\textcopyright} 2019 Faculty of Engineering, Universitas Indonesia.},

abstract = {Introduction: The emerging of energy and environmental thread has fostered a new cultural design approach to Sustainable Architecture that aims to conceive and implement buildings with a low environmental impact. In this context the role of Building Information Modelling (BIM), as a support tool for sustainable integrated design, acquires great relevance. The purpose of this study is to investigate BIM potential in both addressing preliminary design choices and supporting complex analysis during the advanced design phase, within the whole sustainable design process. A technological rail building is assumed as a case study: the Operation Control Centre for the new Oman Railway, whose preliminary project was elaborated by the Italian engineering society Italferr s.p.a. Methods: The BIM approach is used to identify possible problems and deficiencies in the preliminary project, which may represent a good basis for a next design improvements proposal. The next phase consists in investigating and experimenting BIM tools potential in supporting the Conceptual Design, by using Autodesk{\textregistered} Revit{\textregistered} and IES VE{\textregistered} software suites, for the modelling and the energy analysis of different conceptual design solutions. Once the optimal building shape is established, the study focuses on the evaluation of sustainability effects brought by the structural building component, in particular for what concerns its materials environmental impact. Results and discussion: The analysis of the preliminary project shows the potential of BIM in the control of many performance parameters of a building in the design phase, revealing all the design problems associated to the lack of an integral multi-disciplinary approach during the initial phases of the process. The possibility of looking into a series of solutions in a quick and in-depth manner permits an accurate assessment of the most adequate form for a building based on the place in which it is set, thus joining current technological design methods to traditional bio-climatic methods, reinstating the strong and inevitable link between site and building. {\textcopyright} 2019 St. Petersburg State University of Architecture and Civil Engineering.

abstract = {Modeling approaches and energy assessment techniques vary based on the building's size, location, materials, and functions. In this paper, a real-time residential apartment building is designed using SketchUp and modeled using OpenStudio software plug-in tool. Simulations for two materials of construction, namely, brick (burnt red-clay) and exfoliated vermiculite (EV) are obtained, correspondingly. The total building energy scenario for the two materials are discussed in detail for four different climatic conditions in India such as hot-dry (Trichy), warm-humid (Chennai), moderate (Bangalore), and composite (New Delhi) zones, respectively. A significant reduction of the net site energy, annual energy demand, annual energy use intensity (EUI), and annual electricity consumption are noticed for the EV building compared to the building with brick construction material. Similarly, almost half of the building's HVAC load (527.53 kWh) is saved in case of EV than that of the brick construction (1025.75 kWh). This is due to the higher thermal resistance and lower heat transmittance properties of the EV material. From the study, it is identified that EV could be more suitable for utility in building applications for providing better indoor thermal comfort. Furthermore, the integrated whole building thermal analysis by OpenStudio software model is found to be more flexible and adaptable for small residential buildings across varied climatic conditions in India.

This paper presents the development and evaluation of an approach integrating these four perspectives that was developed within an Architectural Science undergraduate program. A data-driven design project was incorporated into the curriculum to give students opportunities to engage with BIM-based simulation (cost and energy) to guide their design studio project development. The pedagogical approach is discussed, along with refinements to this project based on early implementation. Four years of data are analyzed, consisting of 1325 design iterations and student feedback on the project. A critical evaluation of the project determined that it was highly effective to engage students at an advanced level - level 4 (Analyze) of Bloom's Taxonomy was consistently achieved (over 96{\%} of students) and two thirds of students also engaged meaningfully at Level 5 (Evaluate; 67{\%}) and/or 6 (Create; 8{\%})-while developing a high degree of competence in the use of BIM. {\textcopyright} 2019 by the authors.},

abstract = {The ionosphere is significant to solar-terrestrial space environment, and the ionospheric delay is considered as one main error source in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). For GNSS single-frequency users, broadcast ionospheric models (BIMs) play an important role in mitigating the ionospheric delay. Solar activity induces ionospheric disturbances, which can reduce the performance of GNSS. In this study, solar flares impact on Global Positioning System/BeiDou satellite navigation System/Galileo (GPS/BDS/GALILEO) BIMs was investigated in the Asia-Pacific region. Twelve X-class and M-class large solar flares were selected for this study. Total electron content (TEC) derived from selected International GNSS Service and Crustal Movement Observation Network of China (CMONOC) were used to analyze the TEC anomalies and the adaptability of the GPS/BDS/GALILEO BIMs during sample solar flare events. It is verified that very noticeable sudden increase in TEC clearly took place during solar flares. The temporal variation of rate of TEC is more pronounced and rapid with respect to that of TEC. Especially, solar flares impact on the correction accuracy of the GPS/BDS/GALILEO BIMs is significant, as illustrated by a noticeable decrease in relative difference between the observed and modeled TEC values of the GPS/BDS/GALILEO BIMs occurred during the events. Through our investigation, we found that the adaptability of BDS BIM is better than GPS and GALILEO BIMs under solar flare conditions because its coefficients were updated more frequently, while the accuracy of the GALILEO BIM is the highest among current GPS/BDS/GALILEO BIMs in general. {\textcopyright}2018.

abstract = {Prefabrication is undergoing significant growth in the building and construction sector in China. Meanwhile, the integrated measurement and reduction solution for energy consumption is quickly becoming an important target of scientific efforts and research, especially in prefabricated buildings. Embedded energy consumption requirements can potentially be reduced during the manufacturing process of prefabricated components: the opportunity for its reduction can be significant. This paper aims to propose a BIM and LCA integrated approach that enables the energy consumption of prefabricated components in the manufacturing stage to be extracted and calculated in order to obtain a clear, precise understanding of the energy consumption management in prefabrication. To enhance the energy consumption description of prefabricated components, this paper clarifies the contents of energy consumption inventory and related calculation formula in raw material extraction and production, material transportation, and factorized production of prefabricated components, respectively. Specifically, considering that current Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) standard does not accommodate entities with energy consumption information or relationships, it applies the IFC extension method to connect the energy consumption inventory with the BIM model. The proposed approach is applied and verified in a case study from China. This study reveals that energy consumption control should be investigated in the element level considering the differences of various prefabricated components' requirements in the manufacturing stage. {\textcopyright} 2019 Zhao Xu et al.},

This motivated the application of sustainability rating systems of buildings away from their origins which is hindered by the different attributes and weights. Hence, this study developed a global sustainability rating tool for existing buildings, considering the regional variations through proposing sustainability assessment attributes and determining their weights utilizing fuzzy logic. Data was collected through Canadian and Egyptian experts' questionnaires to stand for the impact of the regional variations on the weight values. Fuzzy topsis was implemented to overcome the uncertainties inherent when considering opinions of individuals. Consequently, the assessment model and the ranking scheme were developed. In addition to questionnaires, the model was implemented using BIM modeling and energy simulations for two cases in the Canadian and Egyptian environments. The results showed that weights vary from country to another, however, energy criteria deemed to have nearly the same weight in both countries. Also, the results showed the ability of the proposed model to address the regional variations through the developed multi-level weight model. The model was validated by applying sensitivity analysis. The developed sustainability assessment model is a step towards a globally working sustainability rating tool that can address regional variations. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {With buildings around the world accounting for nearly one-third of global energy demand and the availability of fossil fuels constantly on the decline, there is a need to ensure that this energy demand is efficiently and effectively managed using renewable energy now more than ever. Most research and case studies have focused on energy efficiency of 'new' buildings. In this study, both technical and financial viability of Net Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) for 'existing' buildings will be highlighted. A rigorous review of open literatures concerning seven principal areas that in themselves define the concept of NZEB building is carried out. In practice, a suitable option of the NZEB solutions is needed for the evaluation and improvement for a specific geographical area. The evaluation and improvement has been carried out using a novel hierarchy-flow chart coupled with a Building Information Model (BIM). This BIM or digital twin is then used to thoroughly visualize each option, promote collaboration among stakeholders, and accurately estimate associated costs and associated technical issues encountered with producing an NZEB in a pre-determined location. This paper also provides a future model for NZEB applications in existing buildings, which applies renewable technologies to the building by aiming to identify ultimate benefit of the building especially in terms of effectiveness and efficiency in energy consumption. It is revealed that the digital twin is proven to be feasible for all renewable technologies applied on the NZEB buildings. Based on the case study in the UK, it can be affirmed that the suitable NZEB solution for an existing building can achieve the 23 year return period. {\textcopyright} 2018 by the authors.},

abstract = {This research work uses a simplified approach to combine location information from a beacon's propagation signal interaction with a mobile device sensor (accelerometer and gyroscope) with local building information to give real-time location and guidance to a user inside a building. This is an interactive process with visualisation information that can help user's orientation inside unknown buildings and the data stored from different users can provide useful information about users' movements inside a public building. Beacons installed on the building at specific pre-defined positions emit signals that give a geographic position with an associated imprecision, related with Bluetooth's range. This uncertainty is handled by building layout and users' movement in a developed system that maps users' position, gives guidance, and stores user movements. This system is based on an App (Find Me!) for Android OS (Operating System) which captures the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signal coming from the beacon(s) and shows, through a map, the location of the user's smartphone and guide him to the desired destination. Also, the beacons can deliver relevant context information.

abstract = {With the advent of wireless sensing technology and interest in tracking resources, researchers have developed advanced tracking algorithms by using one or more sensor systems for improved accuracy and reliability of tracking. The objective of this research lies in another aspect−deployment−of tracking that has received only little attention until now. The research explores a method for sensor deployment particularly designed for the building in which the sensors are used. To tailor our solution to a specific building, we integrate a building information model with an electromagnetic energy analysis. By using such a model, the system extracts the properties of building materials, which are used as parameters of sensor deployment optimization. Then, we find a method of optimizing the deployment of a Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI)-based tracking sensors for reducing wireless energy dissipation during the operation of the tracking system. For the numerical validation of the proposed method, the High-Frequency Structural Simulator (HFSS) runs an electromagnetic simulation to generate comparison data of electromagnetic energy flow from optimized sensor deployment and random sensor deployment. The results indicate that the proposed method could produce results that are correlated to the HFSS results. In addition, the method shows clear evidence of a reduction in signal power loss. Finally, optimized sensor deployment through the proposed framework can use signals of electromagnetic energy more effectively and potentially improve the efficiency of the RSSI-based tracking system. {\textcopyright} 2018, Korean Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract = {The Air Handling Unit (AHU) is one of the most energy consuming devices in building systems. Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) methods integrated into AHUs can help to ensure that they comply with the intended design, and their efficiency is maintained throughout the entire operational stage of the building. Nonetheless, the implementation and deployment of FDDs at the operational stage require an extensive effort. Especially, FDD approaches that rely on first principle models (model-based FDD) need to be manually implemented, and the information necessary for this process is scattered between several exchange formats and files, thus making it time-consuming, error-prone and subject to modellers' poor judgment. This study aims at facilitating and partially automating the implementation and deployment of model-based FDD. An automated tool-chain that combines a BIM (Building Information Model)-to-BEPS (Building Energy Performance Simulation) tool with a model-based FDD approach is developed. The contribution of this paper lies in the extension of an existing BIM to Modelica BEPS method with an automated calibration approach and a novel model-based FDD. These three elements are integrated in a framework (implemented using Python) to reduce experts' involvement in FDD implementation and deployment. The developed model-based FDD combines a parity relation procedure for fault detection and profile identification for fault diagnosis. The latter uses the robust multi-objective optimisation algorithm NSGA-2. An error is detected when the difference between prediction and measured data over a specific time window is superior to a predefined threshold. The origin of the error is subsequently identified by estimating the profile of the different controllable components' control signal. The developed tool-chain was applied to an actual AHU as well as on several numerical scenarios to identify typical AHU faults such as faulty dampers, valves and sensors. This study shows that the developed model-based FDD approach can identify some of the most common faults in AHUs, but more importantly that BIM can facilitate the deployment of model-based FDD in building systems. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Heating and cooling energy consumption of buildings accounts for a large portion of global energy use and is significantly affected by the air conditioning system in the buildings. In order to predict the energy performance of buildings, various energy simulation engines have been developed and recently applied to the BIM data of buildings. However, due to the interoperability between them, estimating heating and cooling energy at the design stage of the air conditioning system, in collaboration with the building model, still lacks of efficiency and accuracy. In this paper a highly efficient design framework with enhancement of interoperability that enables the designing of a variable refrigerant flow (VRF) type air conditioning system in BIM environments and to analyze its energy behavior is proposed. The framework covers i) computing the energy load of a building, ii) designing a VRF system that includes equipment selection, layout and piping, and iii) predicting energy consumption by the system with consideration of the building's thermal properties and annual weather conditions. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in the fact that the layout and piping for air conditioning system are enabled inside a BIM environment to maximize interoperability. We implemented the framework as an add-in program to the commercial BIM software and present its accuracy in comparison with the reference data provided by ASHARE. {\textcopyright} 2018, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

Furthermore, the binding activities of their main polyphenols to the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 were investigated. Based on HPLC-MS/MS results, 22 secondary metabolites were characterized in L. stuhlmannii (mainly tannins), while 20 secondary metabolites (mainly sulphated tannins) were identified in L. humilis. Both extracts exhibited substantial antioxidant activities in vitro and counteracted D-galactosamine induced intoxication in rats in vivo and increased the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of liver tissues. In addition to reducing the elevated levels of AST and total bilirubin, both extracts significantly attenuated the deleterious histopathologic changes in liver after D-galactosamine-intoxication. Also, both extracts protected hepatocytes from apoptotic cell death and increased the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. The identified compounds from both extracts can bind to the Bcl-2: Bim (BH3) interface with an appreciable binding free energy. Hydrogen and ionic bonds and hydrophobic interactions with amino acid residues in the hydrophobic face of Bim (BH3) domain were discovered. To sum up, L. humilis and L. stuhlmanni exhibited promising hepatoprotective activities in vivo against D-GalN-induced liver injury and their hepatoprotection is due to the antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects of tannins and proanthocyanidins. {\textcopyright} 2018 The Author(s).},

EniServizi, aware of the BIM potential role in the complex building and infrastructure domain in the world, required an advanced HBIM based on laser scanner and photogrammetric surveying to address decision-making processes among the different actors involved in the preservation process. The Basilica of Collemaggio has been re-opened to the public on December 2017. This paper tries to make a synthesis of the different lessons learnt, in relation to both positive and critical aspects relating HBIM feasibility, sustainability and usefulness to the challenging restoration and preservation field. The theoretical and practical HBIM approach here tackled overcomes the current BIM logic based on the sequential process adopted by the AIA and NBS Level of Development (LOD), characterized by a simple-to-complex-detailing process, working in the new construction domain and generally following the conceptualizing phase, the preliminary design, the executive design, the construction phase till to the facility management. A complex-mixed LOD approach, able to entail the richness, unicity and multiplicity of each component and to get the maximum degree of knowledge, has been experimented in order to derive informed decisions in terms of preservation, restoration and management since the starting phases of the architectural design. To this aim, a Level of Geometry (LOG) coherent to the Level of Accuracy gained by the high-resolution surveys has been adapted to the specificity of the restoration process of a historic monument and is here proposed through different Grade of Generation (GOG) protocols developed in the object modelling to support the preliminary and definitive design proposal of the conservation plan of the Basilica. Particularly, a NURBS-based parametric generative modelling process (GOG9-10) is here proposed in order to get models “BIM abled” to describe the complex geometry and to match the related information. Specific Level of Information (LOI) has been introduced to support the preservation process, to document the as-built and the management of the building after the intervention, moving HBIM toward multi-actor domain. Given the effort required by such approach, obtaining a cost-effective HBIM modelling embodying the complexity of each damaged element as acquired by the surveys (i.e. walls, pillars, vaults, beams) represents a challenging issue. The result of the overall process aims to contribute in lowering the initial HBIM modelling costs by deploying a sustainable complexity delivering protocols and specification and by boosting at the same time an interoperable cooperative HBIM habit among multi-actors across all the phases, spreading its usability after the restoration process. On the lesson learnt, the process of updating the current Codification criteria (UNI11337-2009) has been started with a draft proposal stimulating the debate for the future of HBIM adoption in the case of restoration, preservation and maintenance (UNI11337-2017): in the conviction that transferring the HBIM richness into the Life Cycle Management process will allow multi-actors to take in account the knowledge and information gained during the restoration, integrating the as-built updating and keeping updated the monument monitoring during the time being. {\textcopyright} 2018, Societ{\`{a}} Italiana di Fotogrammetria e Topografia (SIFET).},

abstract = {Apartments in South Korea have high maintenance costs and an average lifetime of 25 years due to poor construction qualities. The common apartment redevelopment strategy is completely demolishing the neighborhoods and then replacing them with new buildings. However, this research discusses the framework for the refurbishment of an existing building in Seoul using Building Information Modeling (BIM) and parametric tools. The virtual model of an exemplary existing building is constructed in a BIM environment. Parametric software is used to simulate the building's environmental performance, in order to determine its energy demand for heating and cooling and the indoor comfort. In order to reduce the energy demand for heating and cooling, improve the indoor comfort, generate photovoltaic energy and extend the building's lifetime, a modular building envelope renovation system is developed. Building simulation results of the improved building envelope are used to quantify the differences with the existing building. The research results illustrate significant improvements in energy performance, comfort and lifetime extension that can be achieved. Furthermore, a guideline for a streamlined building optimization process is provided, that can be transferred and used for the planning and optimization of other building renovation projects. {\textcopyright} 2018 by the authors.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present a pedagogical practice in the project-based assessment of architectural, engineering and construction (AEC) students' interdisciplinary building design work adopting BIM. This pedagogical practice emphasizes the impacts of BIM, as the digital collaboration platform, on the cross-disciplinary teamwork design through information sharing. This study also focuses on collecting students' perceptions of building information modeling (BIM) effects in integrated project design. Challenges in BIM adoption from AEC students' perspective were identified and discussed, and could spark further research needs. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a thorough review of previous pedagogical practices of applying BIM in multiple AEC disciplines, this study adopted a case study of the Solar Decathlon (SD) residential building design as the group project for AEC students to deliver the design work and construction planning. In total 13 different teams within the University of Nottingham Ningbo China, each group consisting of final year undergraduate students with backgrounds in architecture, civil engineering, and architectural environmental engineering, worked to deliver the detailed design of the solar-powered residential house meeting pre-specified project objectives in terms of architectural esthetics, structural integrity, energy efficiency, prefabrication construction techniques and other issues such as budget and scheduling. Each team presented the cross-disciplinary design plan with cost estimate and construction scheduling together within group reports. This pedagogical study collected students' reflective thinking on how BIM affected their design work, and compared their feedback on BIM to that from AEC industry professionals in previous studies. Findings: The case study of the SD building project showed the capacity of BIM in enabling interdisciplinary collaboration through information exchange and in enhancing communication across different AEC fields. More sustainable design options were considered in the early architectural design stages through the cross-disciplinary cooperation between architecture and building services engineering. BIM motivated AEC student teams to have a more comprehensive design and construction plan by considering multiple criteria including energy efficiency, budget, and construction activities. Students' reflections indicated both positive effects of BIM (e.g. facilitating information sharing) as well as challenges for further BIM implementation, for example, such as some architecture students' resistance to BIM, and the lack of existing family types in the BIM library, etc. Research limitations/implications: Some limitations of the current BIM pedagogy were identified through the student group work. For example, students revealed the problem of interoperability between BIM (i.e. Autodesk Revit) and building energy simulation tools. To further integrate the university education and AEC industry practice, future BIM pedagogical work could recruit professionals and project stakeholders in the adopted case studies, for the purpose of providing professional advice on improving the constructability of the BIM-based design from student work. Practical implications: To further integrate the university education and AEC industry practice, future BIM pedagogical work could recruit professionals and project stakeholders in the adopted case study, for the purpose of providing professional advice in improving the constructability of the BIM-based design from student work. Originality/value: This work provides insights into the information technology applied in the AEC interdisciplinary pedagogy. Students gained the experience of a project-based collaboration and were equipped with BIM capabilities for future employment within the AEC job market. The integrated design approach was embedded throughout the team project process. Overall, this BIM pedagogical practice emphasized the link between academic activities and real-world industrial practice. The pedagogical experience gained in this BIM course could be expanded to future BIM education and research in other themes such as interoperability of building information exchange among different digital tools. {\textcopyright} 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {In this work, the electronic bandstructure of GaAs1-xBix/GaAs single quantum well (QW) samples grown by molecular beam epitaxy is investigated by photomodulated reflectance (PR) measurements as a function of Bi content (0.0065 ≤ x ≤ 0.0215) and substrate orientation. The Bi composition is determined via simulation of high-resolution x-ray diffraction measurement and is found to be maximized in the 2.15{\%}Bi and 2.1{\%}Bi samples grown on (100) and (311)B GaAs substrates. However, the simulations indicate that the Bi composition is not only limited in the GaAsBi QW layer but extends out of the GaAsBi QW towards the GaAs barrier and forms a GaAsBi epilayer. PR spectra are fitted with the third derivative function form (TDFF) to identify the optical transition energies. We analyze the TDFF results by considering strain-induced modification on the conduction band (CB) and splitting of the valence band (VB) due to its interaction with the localized Bi level and VB interaction. The PR measurements confirm the existence of a GaAsBi epilayer via observed optical transitions that belong to GaAsBi layers with various Bi compositions. It is found that both Bi composition and substrate orientation have strong effects on the PR signal. Comparison between TDFF and calculated optical transition energies provides a bandgap reduction of 92 meV/{\%}Bi and 36 meV/{\%}Bi and an interaction strength of the isolated Bi atoms with host GaAs valence band (C BiM ) of 1.7 eV and 0.9 eV for (100) and (311)B GaAs substrates, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

At the same time, the combination of advanced design models and tools such as Building Information Modeling (BIM) and environmental assessment methodologies such as Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) offer the opportunity for undertaking holistic technical, economic and environmental approaches for the environmental design of buildings. This study aspires to deliver a comprehensive model for the optimal computational design of building overhangs through the use of an integrated building information model. The analysis is implemented for different normalized shading projection geometries, different orientations and different climatic data, using well- established BIM and LCA tools. The energy intensity indicators of the alternative overhang designs, as well as their energy depreciation time are presented.

abstract = {The built environment provides significant opportunities for IoT (Internet of Things) deployment, and can be singled out as one of the most important aspects for IoT related research. While the IoT deployment in the built environment is growing exponentially, there exists a gap in integrating these two in a systematic way through open standards and systems. From technological perspective, there is a need for convergence of diverse fields ranging from Building Information Systems and Building Services to Building Automation Systems, and IoT devices and finally the end user services to develop smart, user oriented applications. This paper outlines the efforts to develop a platform that integrates the built environment data with IoT sensors in a campus wide, web based system called Otaniemi3D that provides information about energy usage, occupancy and user comfort by integrating Building Information Models and IoT devices through open messaging standards (O-MI and O-DF) and IFC models. The paper describes the design criteria, the system architecture, the workflow and a proof of concept with potential use cases that integrate IoT with the built environment. Initial results show that both the end users and other research groups can benefit from such platforms by either consuming the data in their daily life or using the data for more advance research. {\textcopyright} 2018 The Authors},

abstract = {Buildings have a remarkable impact on the environment, therefore finding efficient design configurations satisfying conflicting criteria such as, economic and environmental performance has become an important task. The aim of this study is to propose a methodology to aid designers in satisfying the requirements of government regulations and green building certification programs, while optimizing the energy consumption and maintaining the thermal comfort. In this context, a software package combining a tailor-made thermal simulation software and Matlab Optimtool is developed to implement proposed methodology. The developed software package offers an effective method to perform large number of simulations to find optimal building configuration. The software package was tested on a reference building that represents a typical residential building in Turkey. The testing process is conducted on a five story building located in Istanbul and building information such as building size, location and occupation schedule were used within the developed software. Based on an extensive market search for building materials, cost functions for each parameter were developed as well as a database required for optimization process. A genetic algorithm optimization technique was utilized to minimize the objective function and find the optimal building configuration for the selected building. Development of a simulation-based optimization method fulfills the need for a tool that assists designers to find better design alternatives at the conceptual design stage. The software package requires least amount of data input for energy simulation process to improve usability. A tailor-made energy simulation module was developed to significantly reduce optimization time period. Besides, instead of coupling two separate software packages, performing the energy simulation and optimization processes on a single platform (MATLAB) reduces the time required to find optimal design and eliminates compatibility issues. Developing simulation-based optimization software on a single platform increased the flexibility and user-friendliness of the software. The effectiveness of the approach for finding optimal building configuration is demonstrated in the presented test cases. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Mechanochromic luminescent materials have attracted much attention and present a variety of applications in information security, data recording, and storage devices. However, most of these smart luminescent systems are based on typical fluorescence and/or phosphorescence mechanisms; the mechanochromic delayed fluorescence (MCDF) materials involving switching singlet and triplet states are rarely studied to date. Herein, new 2D layered metal–organic micro/nanosheets, [Cd(9-AC)2(BIM)2] (named as MCDF-1; 9-AC = anthracene-9-carboxylate and BIM = benzimidazole) and its solvate form containing interlayer CH3CN (named as MCDF-2), which exhibit reversible mechanochromic delayed fluorescence characteristics, are presented. With applying the mechanical force, the luminescent center of MCDF-1 can be converted from 9-AC/BIM exciplex to 9-AC/9-AC excimer, resulting in alternations of delayed fluorescence. Such luminescent change can be further recovered by CH3CN fumigation, accompanied by the structural transformation from MCDF-1 to MCDF-2. Furthermore, the force-responsive process also refers to the energy redistribution between singlet and triplet states as inferred by both temperature-dependent photophysics and theoretical calculations. Therefore, this work not only develops new 2D micro/nanosheets as MCDF materials, but also supplies a singlet–triplet energy switching mechanism on their reversible mechanochromic process. {\textcopyright} 2018 The Authors.

abstract = {In the past few decades, sustainability has become one of the world's most important but also controversial subjects. The construction industry, in particular, has a significant impact on societies' sustainability, prompting the creation of certifications and standards designed for mitigating the impact of buildings on the natural environment. However, despite the efforts to clearly quantify a sustainable building, the complexity of this term and its assessment, challenge an easy evaluation. This article aims to connect Building Information Modelling (BIM) and sustainability, by means of an automated BIM-based software, to tackle this problem. This software, which was developed as a plugin for BIM-modelling software, assists on updating the applied certification by simplifying its parameters, easing its calculations and helping the user choose the credits to acquire. The example certification is Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). However, since sustainability is such a broad topic, this article limits itself to a portion of LEED, extracting overall conclusions from the acquired results. This particular portion relates to stormwater runoff management, proposing an intuitive tool to calculate the runoff of a building site, regardless of building type, while also offering Low-Impact Development (LID) Best Managing Practices (BMP) to address the issues identified. {\textcopyright} 2018, {\textcopyright} 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\&} Francis Group.},

In this paper we propose a structured approach towards the creation of a building information model of an existing building and its use for the purpose of retrofitting or renovation, based on the standard IFC specification (ISO 16739). It implies a process we define as BIMification. This process undergoes two major stages: (1) Anamnesis, dedicated to the survey and collection of facts about the building, and (2) Diagnosis, dedicated to the analysis and interpretation of the collected facts to obtain the necessary understanding of the building and its performance and prepare for the retrofitting design. The paper outlines the broader research aim that triggered the development of the suggested approach and presents the overall concept and methodology, the ICT platform under implementation and the current state of the work. Discussed are also the scope of the approach, envisaged perspectives and further development efforts. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Considerable efforts have been made to reduce buildings' operational energy use over the last decades, but little attention has been paid to reduce the material transportation and construction energy. Focusing only on the operation phase forgoes the opportunity to reduce other building-related energy consumption, and even if the environmental impacts arising from construction and transportation are small as compared to the operation phases, its cumulative impact at the national level is of concern. The energy consumed by a building is divided into two parts embodied energy and operation energy. Further, the embodied energy is constituted of energy intensity of materials, energy consumed during transportation and energy consumed for construction. This paper proposes a methodology to integrate embodied energy consumption into a BIM platform and provides a seamless analysis based on available information. Plug-ins are developed to fulfill a convenient linkage between the BIM model and external databases. Simulation models are created, which can be used as templates for energy optimization during transportation and construction. By analyzing different resource combination scenarios, lower energy consumption can be achieved. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

A case building, the University of Maryland's Architecture Building, was used to demonstrate the validity of the framework and a set of building performance indicators-including energy performance, environmental impacts, and occupant satisfaction-were used to evaluate renovation strategies. Additionally, this novel framework further demonstrated the interoperability among different digital tools and platforms. Lastly, following a detailed analysis and measurements, the case study results highlighted a particular energy profile as well as the retrofit needs of education buildings. Eight different renovation packages were analyzed with the top-ranking package indicating an energy saving of 62{\%}, carbon emissions reduction of 84{\%}, and long-term cost savings of 53{\%}, albeit with a relatively high initial cost. The most preferable package ranked second in all categories, with a moderate initial cost. {\textcopyright} 2018 by the authors.},

abstract = {Layered materials beyond graphene have generated renewed interests in numerous fields. Liquid-phase exfoliation methods face essential challenges in their universal application toward various two-dimensional materials (2DMs), short processing time, high yield, chemical stability, ultrathin thickness, and large lateral size of the nanosheets. To date, few reported methods are satisfactory in these requirements. We develop a general microwave-assisted, rapid (30 min), efficient (up to 50{\%} yield), and potentially scalable approach to exfoliate 2DMs into mono- and few-layer nanosheets of superior chemical stability and large lateral size. 2DMs including h-BN, g-C3N4, BP, TMDs (MoS2, WS2, MoSe2), Zn2(bim)4, and Ti3C2Tx are tested for exfoliation in different fluid media including organic solvents and PF6 --containing ionic liquids (ILs). The nanosheets (e.g., BP) are surprisingly stable, probably attributed to solvation shells preventing the exfoliated sheets from reacting with water and oxygen. Theoretical simulations reveal that the dielectric constant of the fluid medium is a key factor determining the exfoliation efficiency. The preferred fluid media should be strongly polar (e.g., organic solvents with a high dielectric constant), which indicates materials' ability to store electromagnetic energy via polarization. Finally, we demonstrate the 3D printing of nanosheet-based hybrids for potential applications. This general strategy paves a new promising pathway for the efficient liquid exfoliation of various 2DMs. {\textcopyright} 2018 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {In high-density, high-rise cities such as Hong Kong, buildings account for nearly 90{\%} of energy consumption and 61{\%} of the carbon emissions. Therefore, it is important to study the design of buildings, especially high-rise buildings, so as to achieve lower carbon emissions. The carbon emissions of a building consist of embodied carbon from the production of construction materials and operational carbon from energy consumption during daily operation (e.g., air-conditioning and lighting). While most of the previous studies concentrated mainly on either embodied or operational carbon, an integrated analysis of both types of carbon emissions can improve the sustainable design of buildings. Therefore, this paper presents a holistic framework using building information modeling (BIM) technology in order to enhance the sustainable low carbon design of high-rise buildings. BIM provides detailed physical and functional characteristics of buildings that can be integrated with various environmental modeling approaches to achieve a holistic design and assessment of low carbon buildings. In a case study, the proposed framework is examined to evaluate the embodied and operational carbon in a high-rise residential building due to various envelope designs. The results demonstrate how the BIM framework provides a decision support basis for evaluating the key carbon emission sources throughout a building's life cycle and exploring more environmentally sustainable measures to improve the built environment. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Energy generation by photovoltaic (PV) installations on residential building envelopes in tropical area was evaluated by using a new practical method employing 3D analysis. Calculations of monthly global radiation were used to investigate solar potential in the study case area. In order to simulate optimal locations of PV panel installation, BIM Revit software was used to quantify the incident solar radiation and for color rendering of different levels experienced in different areas of the building envelope due to Sun path and the influence of the local environment. The amount of energy generated by hypothetical PV panels was compared to actual residential sector energy consumption which became a baseline for evaluating the prospective implementation of PV in a tropical area. The results indicated that the optimal location for installing PV panels was on the roof of a building where incident solar radiation levels are high and uniform throughout the year. In addition, the walls of the building oriented to the East and West have a great potential to harvest electrical energy as an optional location for photovoltaic panel installation. The potentially available photovoltaic energy generated was compared to the actual electrical energy consumption and demonstrated a favourable surplus for electrical energy supply. The energy surplus provided by three types of photovoltaic output varied from 172{\%} to 1700{\%} above the baseline consumption, thus installing photovoltaics on residential buildings could have a strong potential to secure both current energy consumption and future energy demand. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Reducing building environmental impacts is becoming an increasing challenge. Lifecycle assessment (LCA) is recognized as a method that can help to reduce the environmental impact of the building sector. The LCA can be used as an early-stage decision-making tool to assess design choices that impact the environment. The present paper developed a method based on LCA that integrates building information modeling (BIM) to assess building envelope alternatives. The method is validated by the application in a single-family house, which is the most popular typology, in Uruguay, considering three envelope alternatives including frequent and nonfrequent materials. Results focused on comparing the embodied impacts, transport, and operational energy consumptions of each scenario. The results show that the developed method can help during the building design process, especially when defining dimension and thickness of materials. {\textcopyright} 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Assuming the prevalence of orthogonal intersections between walls, indoor completion is formulated as an energy minimization problem using graph cuts.

The framework integrates building information from BIM, environmental information provided by sensors, and regulatory information based on building regulations and design requirements. In this framework, four specific ontologies are developed to represent relevant knowledge. Building information is extracted from BIM and then converted, together with environmental information provided by sensors, into resource description framework format as ontology instances. The regulation clauses are transformed into SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) rules.

abstract = {Building engineers need access to real-time data to make retrofit decisions or improve the energy performance of the building occupants. Such data is typically gathered with the help of fixed wired and/or wireless sensors. Such a process consumes a significant amount of time, effort, and financial resources, particularly in existing buildings which do not have a Building Automation Systems (BAS) installed. This paper introduces a framework that uses autonomous mobile indoor robots for gathering actionable building information in real-time, and discusses how this information can be further utilized for various analyses and critical decision-making. The navigation and drift correction algorithms developed for autonomous robot operation are described in detail. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of the proposed method in large areas using only a sparse set of sensors mounted on mobile indoor robots. This research also developed a generic framework for making informed retrofit decisions with the help of robot collected data. A case study is performed to demonstrate the informed retrofit decision making process with the help of temperature data collected by a robot and subsequently used in an EnergyPlus simulation. Simulated annual energy savings of 3{\%} were obtained by slightly modifying the R-values (20{\%} to 45{\%} improvement) of one of the external wall assemblies. These savings are expected to be larger if whole building retrofit and upgrade of material is performed. Thus, the proposed framework offers promise in improving the energy efficiency by extending the approach to other combinations of building materials (e.g. doors and windows). {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Eco-friendly materials have been developed recently that have made it possible to significantly reduce the maintenance cost of buildings when they are appropriately used in renovation. Indeed, it became extremely important to consider the eco-friendly energy-saving effects on design alternatives during renovation. The present study proposes a framework for the optimum maintenance decision-making model for considering eco-friendly energy to help people interested in making decisions concerning renovation; it requires that both the environmental friendliness and economic feasibility of the target building be simultaneously considered. Several studies mainly cover the structural aspects for energy improvements based on innovation and technology. However, energy simulation in existing buildings needs some additional consideration regarding the economic analysis of energy savings and the recovery period of construction costs. A case study was conducted as a research method by utilizing the proposed framework, which aims to: (1) make energy simulations with different basic design assumptions; (2) perform the energy simulations through building information modeling (BIM) technology; and (3) analyze the economic feasibility of the alternatives. As a result, an alternative combination that can save the net maximum energy cost during the life cycle period and invest the lowest renovation costs has been recommended. Furthermore, effective guidelines were proposed on which items the building owner values, depending on his economic investment conditions in decision-making regarding the level of design, through a comprehensive review of the energy savings by design variable. It is expected that the research findings will be utilized in the decision-making process and for conducting further relevant research in future. {\textcopyright} 2018 by the authors.},

abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) is the digital representation of physical and functional characteristics (such as geometry, spatial relationship, and geographic information) of a facility to support decisions during its life cycle. BIM has been extended beyond 3D geometrical representations in recent years, and now includes time as a fourth dimension and cost as a fifth dimension, as well as such other applications as virtual reality and augmented reality. The Internet of Things (IoT) has been increasingly applied in various products (smart homes, wearables) to enhance work productivity, living comfort, and entertainment. However, research addressing the integration of these two technologies (BIM and IoT) is still very limited, and has focused exclusively on the automatic transmission of sensor information to BIM models. This paper describes an attempt to represent and visualize sensor data in BIM with multiple perspectives in order to support complex decisions requiring interdisciplinary information. The study uses a university campus as an example and includes several scenarios, such as an auditorium with a dispersed audience and energy-saving options for rooms with different functions (mechanical/electrical equipment, classrooms, and laboratory). This paper also discusses the design of a common platform allowing communication among sensors with different protocols (Arduino, Raspberry Pi), the use of Dynamo to accept sensor data as input and automatically redraw visualized information in BIM, and how visualization may help in making energy-saving management decisions. {\textcopyright} 2018 by the authors.},

abstract = {In the design and operations industries, the performance gap is a common discrepancy found between predicted building energy performance and actual energy performance. The performance gap is considered to have negative impacts for the brand of ‘green' buildings, designers and operators. A socially based analogue is proposed here: the qualitative performance gap, defined as the perceived gap between what inhabitants expect and their actual experience of the building environment. This concept is explored at a regenerative Living Lab: the Centre for Interactive Research on Sustainability (CIRS) in Vancouver, Canada. ‘Official' and ‘lived' stories about the building were interpreted from sources of building information and interviews. Expectations about and forgiveness of building performance were gained from pre- and post-occupancy evaluations and interviews. The solution to the qualitative performance gap is not to eliminate it, but, in line with the concept of interactive adaptivity, to use the gap to generate new stories and new consequences for human wellbeing. The qualitative performance gap is thus conceived as positively generative, of new stories of place and identity. This work recommends crafting an ‘official story' of social aspirations, and a communication feedback loop amongst designers, operators and building inhabitants, transparently sharing successes and failures. {\textcopyright} 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\&} Francis Group.},

abstract = {Assessment of the energy associated with the material production, transportation and construction of buildings provides an opportunity for reducing the use of energy and improving sustainability. Building Information Modeling (BIM) provides a platform to incorporate sustainability information in the design of buildings. However, interoperability of BIM with Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tools needs further investigation. Previous research in this area has either partially employed BIM; data was exported from the main BIM authoring tool and then auxiliary tools were utilized to evaluate the model, thereby causing a disconnect between the model and analysis resulting in non-interoperable systems, or has ignored the importance of retaining the LCA results within the BIM environment. To address this issue, this paper presents a framework to estimate the embodied energy content within the native BIM environment. The implementation of this framework is illustrated by the development of a tool for estimation of material embodied energy, transportation energy and construction energy. A prototype of the tool has been implemented on a case project to establish the workability of the framework. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {While technology advancements are improving the energy efficiency of buildings, occupant behavior remains a critical factor in ensuring the effectiveness of such enhancements. To this end, numerous eco-feedback systems have been developed to reduce building energy use through influencing occupants' behaviors during building operations. Information representation is a critical component in eco-feedback systems, affecting the users' interpretation, engagement, and motivation to reduce energy consumption. Many studies have focused on using different charts and technical units or abstract and artistic visualizations to represent energy consumption. However, the effectiveness of such techniques varies across studies. Recent research emphasizes the need to integrate information representation strategies that balance numeric and aesthetic appeal. Concurrently, studies have called for increased adoption of a Building Information Model (BIM) during a building's operations phase to improve facility management. In this paper, we introduce a new eco-feedback information representation method that combines numeric and aesthetic appeal through leveraging spatial and color-coding techniques in BIM. The BIM-integrated energy visualization approach developed in this paper uses the Revit Application Program Interface (API) and allows users to visualize and compare energy consumption values in 2D and 3D views of a multi-family building through a color-coding scheme in an as-built BIM. The method is validated through a user survey that quantitatively and qualitatively assesses the proposed 2D and 3D BIM eco-feedback compared to more traditional bar chart based eco-feedback. Our findings suggest that 2D spatial, color-coded eco-feedback provides the optimal information representation, as it is easy to understand, while evoking engaging and motivating responses from users. This study advances our understanding of eco-feedback information representation while expanding BIM applications during building operations. These are important steps to address the human dimension of energy efficiency in the built environment. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {At present, the capability to collect information from different sources [building information modeling (BIM), sensors, assets database] for asset management (AM) use has generated significant opportunities for asset owners and facility managers. BIM, in particular, is considered as a potentially effective data pool for storing and managing project information during the building life cycle, providing a common data environment for stakeholder data and guaranteeing information availability and credibility at the handover stage. However, this data integration in a BIM environment has issues related to the establishment of an effective process to extract, store, manage, integrate, and distribute data to ensure interoperability. Furthermore, for the interoperability issue, an important challenge is the identification of which data are relevant, reliable, useful, and can add value to the AM processes. This research explored the asset owner requirements from BIM in the operation and maintenance stage from an AM perspective. The research aim was twofold: first, to synthesize the nongeometric BIM data required for AM and develop a relevant taxonomy; and second, to develop an application programming interface (API) plug-in for Autodesk Revit to implement the proposed taxonomy. To achieve the aims of this study, a critical review of previous literature and face-to-face and focus group interviews with BIM and facilities management (FM) experts were conducted. The main output was a 60-parameter asset-consuming energy information management (ACE-IM) taxonomy and the relevant API plug-in that can help BIM professionals to identify the required data to be submitted to facility managers to improve AM processes. {\textcopyright} 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract = {Steadily increasing use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) in all phases of building's lifecycle, together with more attention for openBIM and growing software support for the most recent version of the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC 4) have created a very promising context for an even broader application of Building Energy Performance Simulation (BEPS). At the same time, an urgent need for modeling guidelines and standardization becomes evident. A well-defined BIM-based workflow and a set of tools that fully exploit and extend the possibilities of the openBIM-technology can make the difference when it comes to reliability and cost of BEPS to design, build and operate high-performance buildings. This paper describes the essential elements of this integrated workflow, explains why openBIM comprises much more than just a standardized file-format and what is achieved with the already available technology, namely the Information Delivery Manual (IDM) and a newly developed Model View Definition. This MVD is tailored to the needs of Building Energy Performance Simulation (BEPS) that uses the Modelica language together with a specific library (IDEAS) and can easily be adapted to other libraries. In this project, several tools have been developed to closely integrate BEPS and IFC4. The simulation engine now gets the vast majority of the required input directly from the IFC4-file. For the implementation of the tools, the PYTHON language and the open source library IfcOpenShell are used. A case study is presented, that was used for extensive tests of the proposed approach and the implemented tools. The essential benefits of this new workflow are illustrated, and the feasibility is demonstrated. Opportunities and remaining bottlenecks are identified to encourage further development of BIM software to fully support IFC4 as an information source for BEPS. Besides some improvements of the proprietary class structure and functionality, enabling the export of IFC4 files based on custom MVDs is one required key feature. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Electrical grids need to embed smartness not just at the generation and distribution side but also at the consumption side. Specifically, in regard to office buildings, information technology (IT) loads such as desktops and printers, operating in non-working hours, can lead to significant energy wastage. Detailed understanding and quantification of this wastage can lead to motivational insights for reduction in this wastage. However, it is impractical to monitor such a large number of loads individually. In this paper, we propose a single point smart sensor to detect and track the operation of these IT appliances. Existing methods, based on state-of-the art sensors, have been ineffective at detecting IT loads that have time-varying power consumption patterns. Our proposed sensor detects IT loads using their common mode electromagnetic emissions (CM EMI) injected on the grid. The sensor is low cost, portable, and built using commercial off-the-shelf components. We use a nearest neighbor-based classification algorithm on the statistical features extracted from histograms of the measured CM EMI. Experimental evaluations carried out with multiple instances of commonly found IT appliances display up to 87{\%} detection accuracy, thus validating the real world applicability of our proposed system. {\textcopyright} 2010-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Information on protein–protein interactions (PPIs) is of critical importance for studying complex biological systems and developing therapeutic strategies. Here, we present a double-readout bioluminescence-based two-hybrid technology, termed LuTHy, which provides two quantitative scores in one experimental procedure when testing binary interactions. PPIs are first monitored in cells by quantification of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) and, following cell lysis, are again quantitatively assessed by luminescence-based co-precipitation (LuC). The double-readout procedure detects interactions with higher sensitivity than traditional single-readout methods and is broadly applicable, for example, for detecting the effects of small molecules or disease-causing mutations on PPIs. Applying LuTHy in a focused screen, we identified 42 interactions for the presynaptic chaperone CSP$\alpha$, causative to adult-onset neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (ANCL), a progressive neurodegenerative disease. Nearly 50{\%} of PPIs were found to be affected when studying the effect of the disease-causing missense mutations L115R and ∆L116 in CSP$\alpha$ with LuTHy. Our study presents a robust, sensitive research tool with high utility for investigating the molecular mechanisms by which disease-associated mutations impair protein activity in biological systems. {\textcopyright} 2018 The Authors.

abstract = {The use of building information modeling (BIM) to create a building energy model (BEM) compared with traditional simulation practices offers significant timesaving potentials by minimizing efficiency issues, legal disputes, added costs, and delays. The BIM-BEM strategy avoids remodeling the building to create the BEM by exchanging architectural information to complete the energy analysis. However, most existing frameworks do not simultaneously describe the BIM-BEM process and related technical aspects to be followed during the design process. Therefore, this paper proposes a comprehensive BIM-BEM framework initially created based on theoretical and field investigations and then enhanced by a trial investigation using a testing case. The proposed framework is illustrated in an easy-to-follow process map that includes work/data flows and specifies data exchangers and information requirements. The framework is validated using a complex case study to demonstrate its applicability for different BEM tools. The proposed framework intends to provide the industry with a useful and generic process for BIM-BEM that enables professionals to create proper BIM and BEM to complete energy analysis during the design process. {\textcopyright} 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM), as a rising technology in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry, has been applied to various research topics from project planning, structural design, facility management, among others. Furthermore, with the increasing demand for energy efficiency, the AEC industry requires an expeditious energy retrofit of the existing building stock to successfully achieve the 2020 Energy Strategy targets. As such, this article seeks to survey the recent developments in the energy efficiency of buildings, combining energy retrofitting and the technological capabilities of BIM, providing a critical exposition in both engineering and energy domains. The result is a thorough review of the work done by other authors in relevant fields, comprising the entire spectrum from on-site data acquisition, through the generation of Building Energy Models (BEM), data transfer to energy analysis software and, finally, the identification of major issues throughout this process. Additionally, a BIM-based methodology centered on the acquired knowledge is presented. Solutions for as-built data acquisition such as laser scanning and infrared thermography, and on-site energy tests that benefit the acquisition of energy-related data are explored. The most predominant BIM software regarding not only energy analysis but also model development is examined. In addition, interoperability restrictions between BIM and energy analysis software are addressed using the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and Green Building Extensible Markup Language (gbXML) schemes. Lastly, the article argues the future innovations in this subject, predicting future trends and challenges for the industry. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {The process of preparing building energy performance simulation (BEPS) models involves repetitive manual operations that often lead to data losses and errors. As a result, BEPS model inputs can vary widely from this time consuming, non-standardised and subjective process. This paper proposes a standardised method of information exchange between Building Information Modelling (BIM) and BEPS tools using the Information Delivery Manual (IDM) and Model View Definition (MVD) methodologies. The methodology leverages a collection of use cases to initiate the identification of exchange requirements needed by BEPS tools. The IDM/MVD framework captures and translates exchange requirements into the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) schema. The suggested approach aims to facilitate the transfer of information from IFC based BIM to either conventional or advanced BEPS tools (e.g. EnergyPlus and Modelica) through the development of a specific MVD that defines a subset of the IFC data model that deals with building energy performance simulation. By doing so, the potential of BIM-based simulation can be fully unlocked, and a reliable and consistent IFC subset is provided as an input for energy simulation software. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

Modernist urban detached/semi-detached and suburban row houses often have insufficient green areas and lack consideration of the climatic features of the building site where the neighbourhoods are designed without concern for urban planning laws and regulations. These purpose-built residential building stock models represent 30{\%} of the existing building stock. This research primarily investigates the potential of particular design interventions in detached two-storey houses in a Mediterranean climate in order to reduce the need for fossil fuel to heat and cool the houses. The aim of this study is to develop and test feasible retrofit strategies aimed at optimising the energy performance of the existing residential buildings. To accomplish this, the study first examines the energy performance of a building before and after the retrofitting phases as base case scenario models. The Autodesk Revit 2017 plug-in Green Building Studio energy performance analysis software was used for simulation of the adapted energy-efficient retrofit measures. This study also outlines the results from the prototype analysis to demonstrate the difference between a retrofitted building and the existing state of a building in their respective energy use impacts. {\textcopyright} 2019 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The thermal performance of building envelopes has a profound effect on maintaining indoor environmental conditions and is critical in obtaining an energy-efficient design. Choosing appropriate building envelope materials is one of the most effective ways to manage heat flows, prevent excessive building energy consumption, and maintain a comfortable temperature for occupants. The OTTV standards are popularly used worldwide for assessing the rate of heat transfer through building envelopes. However, manual calculation methods for OTTV are involved functions with various variables and coefficients that need to be considered. Furthermore, computing multiple functions using manual calculation method can be time-consuming and human error can be occurred throughout the completion of the calculation process. Accessing materials' thermal properties from BIM potentially reduce the time required to derive coefficients for the OTTV measurement. Therefore, this research presents a BIM-based approach to provide an automatic assessment of the OTTVs of building envelopes. This study proposes integrating BIM and a developed visual scripting to automatically extract thermal and physical properties from the BIM database for supporting thermal transfer value calculation. The applicability of the proposed system is validated in a BIM model of an office building. The proposed system provides a valuable decision support system for designers to select an appropriate envelope material to achieve an optimum OTTV for optimizing energy-efficient building design.

Smart-POD is a unique and innovative research project which provides an alternative to traditional classroom design. It proposes a rapid deployment building solution, temporary or permanent in its use, modular in design, flexible in set-up and self-sustaining in use, requiring minimal site preparation, and meeting all its energy demands from renewable energy sources. Its feasibility was tested by a design case study which investigated climatic adaptability based on the proposed approach. This approach uniquely combines balancing of energy demand and supply using renewable technologies and a bespoke low temperature thermal store. It further proposes to use an open source Building energy Management System (oBeMS) conceived in this research, to intelligently manage thermal, ventilation and humidity control strategies which adapt to the climate, season and weather in which the building is placed. The predicted performance of proposed system demonstrates potential for an effective diurnal climatic adaptability, enhanced by integrated passive design strategies, and intelligent modes of building control. The method of BIM integrated sustainable design analysis (SDA) and building management system (BMS) has also been deliberated, as a framework for exploring the integration of proposed building management system into smart building environments (SBEs). {\textcopyright} 2018},

abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) is regarded as a potential vehicle to tremendously improve the information flow throughout the life cycle of a building. The integration of BIM and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has potential to reduce the time for life cycle inventory, and at the same time, substantially improve the representativeness of the LCA results for the specific building design. The latter merit is not trivial. For instance, due to time limit, most building LCA studies estimate the building materials and fuels consumed in construction phase quite roughly, which excludes the choices on a wide range of construction techniques, materials, specialties and machines, no need to mention the energy consumption in operation phase, which is usually estimated in an even bolder manner. The roughness of the LCA practice undermines its credibility and hinders its application as a decision supporting tool for low carbon design. Currently, China's Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) sector is undergoing a smart transformation, steered by the increased use of BIM. This paper presents a BIM-enabled LCA method and illustrates how the method can be used to facilitate the low carbon design under the circumstance of the smart AEC transition in China. A case study on carbon footprint accounting for a residential building is conducted. In this study, various software tools and data sources are combined to enhance the data flow and interoperability between BIM models and LCA models. BIM tools are used to create the BIM model, calculate the inputs (materials, construction machines, energies, water and so on) of on-site construction process and simulate the energy consumption of building operation. The eBalance, a China's local LCA software tool is applied to build the LCA model. The Chinese Life Cycle Database is used as the main data source (72.73{\%}) to calculate the carbon footprint of the given building while the Ecoinvent database and European Life Cycle Database act as supplementary. The results show that the carbon footprint of the building is 2993 kg CO2eq/m2. The operation phase contributes to 69{\%} of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, while the building material production contributes to 24{\%}. Concrete is the most used building material, which accounts for 82{\%} of mass but contributes to only 44{\%} of the material related GHG emission. Although steel and aluminum account for only 2.6{\%} and 1.4{\%} of mass, they contribute to 28{\%} and 17{\%} GHG emission, respectively. Through BIM-enable LCA modeling, the potential life cycle environmental performance of the buildings can be assessed in detail. This makes the LCA not only more accessible but also more credible for the AEC professionals to use it as a guide for the low carbon design of buildings. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Most domestic modern buildings from the early 1900s have been constructed as heavy mass, and for many years have relied on passive measures for climate control. Since effective passive measures eventually reduce the heating and cooling loads, thus also reducing the system size, passive and hybrid measures are the most preferred Energy Conservation Measures (ECMs). In addition, the domestic situation and climate are additional constraints in energy retrofit decision making, such as a shorter budget and time, poor maintenance history, and uncertainties in vernacular lifestyle. For this reason, the performance improvement and side-effects prior to installing ECMs should be predictable, particularly in case the originality can be damaged. This complexity confirms that simulation-based Measurement and Verification (M {\&} V) would better suit the energy retrofit of domestic historic buildings. However, many domestic investors still believe re-construction has a larger economic value than restoration. Therefore, they are even unwilling to invest in more time than a preset audit period-typically less than a week. Although simulation-based M {\&} V is theoretically favored for retrofit decision making, its process including collecting data, modeling and analysis, and evaluating and designing ECMs could still be too demanding to domestic practitioners. While some manual, repetitive, error-prone works exist in the conventional retrofit process and simulation-based M {\&} V, it is proposed here that enhanced Building Information Technology (BIT) is able to simplify, automate, and objectify, at least the critical steps of the retrofit project. The aim of this study is to find an efficient and effective energy retrofit strategy for domestic historic buildings that appeals to both domestic investors and practitioners by testing selective BIT tools on an actual historic building. This study concludes with the suggestion that software vendors are asked to develop enhanced features to resolve users' pending demands. It is also suggested that, in the domestic context, how the current practice for each process of the energy retrofit of historic buildings needs to shift to take a full advantage of BIT. {\textcopyright} 2018 by the authors.},

Building information and energy-related data collected from 310 five-star hotels based on a survey is treated as the sample data for developing the hotel energy model using a designer simulation tool (DeST). Instead of giving single value benchmarks, energy use intensity (EUI) intervals of five-star hotels in different climate zones of China are obtained by taking the most advantageous and disadvantageous operation conditions of hotels into consideration. The simulation results show that the EUI intervals of five-star hotels in the cold zone, hot summer/cold winter zone and hot summer/warm winter zone are respectively 100–155, 140–245 and 136–213 kWh/(m2{\textperiodcentered}a), which indicates that there are 54{\%}, 13{\%} and 27{\%} of hotels' energy consumption in these climate zones higher than the upper limits of EUI intervals. The reasons why such a considerable number of hotels' energy consumptions are so large are analyzed. Then several energy-efficient upgrades including building envelop retrofit, internal and external lighting replacement and HVAC upgrades could be further identified based on the energy consumption model proposed in this study. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Prefabricated construction is believed to be energy conserving though opportunities for achieving higher energy efficiency have yet to be fully harnessed. From investigation of a prefabricated construction project in Hong Kong, two main problems have been revealed relating to energy consumption, including: (i) inefficient management of resources such as labours and machines, and (ii) inefficient production, transportation, and on-site assembly of prefabricated components. These problems are primarily caused by lagged information communication and human errors. This paper seeks to offer a solution by developing a Physical Internet-enabled Building Information Modelling System (PI-BIMS) that integrates Auto-ID technologies, BIM, and cloud computing. The PI-BIMS enables real-time collection, communication, and visualisation of information across the processes of production, transportation, and on-site assembly. Practical issues of the system implementation are provided through a pilot prototype. It is found that the PI-BIMS helps enhance the resource allocation efficiency and decrease human errors. Thus, an alternative opportunity to improve energy efficiency in prefabricated construction has become possible. {\textcopyright} 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\&} Francis Group.},

abstract = {Thermal building simulation based on BIM-models. Thermal energetic simulations are used for the estimation of the heating demand of buildings and districts. These simulations are based on building models containing geometrical and physical information. The creation of geometrical models is usually based on existing construction plans or in situ assessments which demand a comparatively big effort of investigation and modeling. Alterations, which are later applied to the structure, request manual changes of the related model, which increases the effort additionally. The physical model represents the total amount of parameters and boundary conditions that are influenced by material properties, location and environmental influences on the building. The link between both models is realized within the correspondent simulation software and is usually not transferable to other software products. By Applying Building Information Modeling (BIM) simulation data is stored consistently and an exchange to other software is enabled. Therefore a method which allows a thermal energetic simulation based on the exchange format Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) including an evaluation is presented. All geometrical and physical information are extracted directly from the building model that is kept up-to-date during its life cycle and transferred to the simulation. This accelerates the simulation process regarding the geometrical modeling and adjustments after later changes of the building. The developed method is based on simple conventions for the creation of the building model and ensures a complete transfer of all simulation data.

abstract = {Urban-scale building energy modeling (UBEM)—using building modeling to understand how a group of buildings will perform together—is attracting increasing attention in the energy modeling field. Unlike modeling a single building, which will use detailed information, UBEM generally uses existing building stock data consisting of high-level building information. This study evaluated the impacts of three zoning methods and the use of floor multipliers on the simulated energy use of 940 office and retail buildings in three climate zones using City Building Energy Saver. The first zoning method, OneZone, creates one thermal zone per floor using the target building's footprint. The second zoning method, AutoZone, splits the building's footprint into perimeter and core zones. A novel, pixel-based automatic zoning algorithm is developed for the AutoZone method. The third zoning method, Prototype, uses the U.S. Department of Energy's reference building prototype shapes. Results show that simulated source energy use of buildings with the floor multiplier are marginally higher by up to 2.6{\%} than those modeling each floor explicitly, which take two to three times longer to run. Compared with the AutoZone method, the OneZone method results in decreased thermal loads and less equipment capacities: 15.2{\%} smaller fan capacity, 11.1{\%} smaller cooling capacity, 11.0{\%} smaller heating capacity, 16.9{\%} less heating loads, and 7.5{\%} less cooling loads. Source energy use differences range from -7.6{\%} to 5.1{\%}. When comparing the Prototype method with the AutoZone method, source energy use differences range from -12.1{\%} to 19.0{\%}, and larger ranges of differences are found for the thermal loads and equipment capacities. This study demonstrated that zoning methods have a significant impact on the simulated energy use of UBEM. One recommendation resulting from this study is to use the AutoZone method with floor multiplier to obtain accurate results while balancing the simulation run time for UBEM. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Along with the development of such tools, their effective implementation in building projects depend on their uptake by holistic design and modelling approaches, with BIM standing out as an exemplary case. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to develop a fully representative economic sustainability assessment framework for residential buildings, with implications for BIM. A serious lag in research within the area of residential building economic sustainability assessment and use of BIM is realized from a systematic review of published studies. Through literature, a taxonomy of economic sustainability indicators, parameters and sub-parameters is developed, which helped design an economic sustainability assessment framework. An international survey and structured interviews are conducted to find the importance weights for the economic sustainability dimension as well as different framework constituents. The functionality of framework is validated through a case study, providing a conclusive value of 48.25{\%} for economic performance of subject building, which is representative of the effectiveness of assessment for decision-makings.

Due to its extensiveness and complexity, but also due to a lack of knowledge amongst architects, the LCA methodology is currently most often applied as a post-design evaluation and not used to support or optimize design decisions during early design stages. Therefore, this paper looks at possible solutions to apply LCA, including operational energy demand simulation, in early design from two different perspectives: design-oriented user requirements, derived from literature, a survey, interviews and a focus group with architects, and LCA simplification strategies based on a literature review. Both perspectives are discussed and merged into an evaluation framework that can be used to check the suitability of LCA-based environmental impact assessment (EIA) tools for use by architects during early design stages, but also to develop new design-supportive LCA-based EIA tools. In turn, this can contribute to an increased uptake of these tools in building practice. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

The challenge was the molecular design of the proton donor and accepter polymer species to each have compatible cross-linkable functional groups as well as proton transfer species in the molecules. Poly(acrylic acid) decorated with different amounts of thiol groups (PAA-M) was synthesized, while benzimidazole decorated branching polyethyleneimine was functionalized with maleimide groups (BIm-PEI-MI). The cross-linkable proton donor and acceptor were alternately LbL deposited on a sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) surface. The LbL membrane with an optimum crosslink level showed a proton conductivity of up to 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of the pure SPEEK membrane even at a temperature as high as 170 °C. {\textcopyright} 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

Most of the available tools only provide total energy consumption related to HVAC system, lighting, hot water, and appliances. While fine-grained data may be available in some computer tools, the process for obtaining these data is time-consuming, error-prone, and requires software-related skills.

This tool, which is referred to as ABEMAT (Automated Building Energy Modeling and Assessment Tool), receives gbXML file and provides users with the amount of heat transfer through every single building envelope component such as windows, doors, and walls through an automated process. ABEMAT's and EnergyPlus advanced outputs are compared for validation; the latter being a time consuming process and error-prone, which requires software-related skills compared to ABEMAT.

abstract = {While advances in information and communication technologies (ICTs) have enabled architects, engineers, and contractors to reduce project time and cost and to improve quality, the diffusion of ICTs has typically been very slow in the construction industry. However, building information modeling (BIM) has overcome this diffusion challenge and has revolutionized such common practices as shifting the design process from two-dimensional (2D) drafting toward three-dimensional (3D) design, automated quantity takeoffs, and clash detection; such success marks the relevance of this technology for studying how technological innovations spread throughout the construction industry. Although some studies have explored BIM adoption, investigations using diffusion models to study the diffusion patterns of different BIM functions (e.g., 3D visualization, clash detection, energy modeling) are missing from the current literature. To fill this gap, this study uses reliable innovation diffusion models to describe the diffusion patterns of various BIM functions in the U.S. construction industry. Specifically, this study developed and sent a comprehensive questionnaire to 3,017 owner representatives, architects, and project managers; 118 individuals responded to the survey, of whom 81 are BIM users. The three most widely adopted BIM functions were 3D visualization, clash detection, and constructability analysis; the least frequently implemented functions were code validation; material tracking, delivery, and management; facility management; and energy analysis. Using these responses, this study analyzed the diffusion patterns of the BIM functions using four innovation diffusion models: internal (logistic), external, Bass, and Gompertz. Using such measures as Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and variants of it, this study identified the Bass model as having the highest explanatory power for diffusion and determined that internal factors (e.g., imitation and bandwagon pressure) have the most influence on adoption rates of BIM functions. Furthermore, the diffusion models showed that the shop-drawing process and facility management functions had the lowest saturation rate in 2014 (below 50{\%}) but have a greater potential for being adopted in coming years. The findings of this study advance knowledge for both researchers and practitioners regarding the adoption process of different BIM functions and provide a theoretical basis for understanding the diffusion patterns of ICT innovations in the construction industry. {\textcopyright} 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract = {Automatic 3D plane segmentation is necessary for many applications including point cloud registration, building information model (BIM) reconstruction, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and point cloud compression. However, most of the existing 3D plane segmentation methods still suffer from low precision and recall, and inaccurate and incomplete boundaries, especially for low-quality point clouds collected by RGB-D sensors. To overcome these challenges, this paper formulates the plane segmentation problem as a global energy optimization because it is robust to high levels of noise and clutter. First, the proposed method divides the raw point cloud into multiscale supervoxels, and considers planar supervoxels and individual points corresponding to nonplanar supervoxels as basic units. Then, an efficient hybrid region growing algorithm is utilized to generate initial plane set by incrementally merging adjacent basic units with similar features. Next, the initial plane set is further enriched and refined in a mutually reinforcing manner under the framework of global energy optimization. Finally, the performances of the proposed method are evaluated with respect to six metrics (i.e., plane precision, plane recall, under-segmentation rate, over-segmentation rate, boundary precision, and boundary recall) on two benchmark datasets. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method obtained good performances both in high-quality TLS point clouds (i.e., SEMANTIC3D.NET dataset) and low-quality RGB-D point clouds (i.e., S3DIS dataset) with six metrics of (94.2{\%}, 95.1{\%}, 2.9{\%}, 3.8{\%}, 93.6{\%}, 94.1{\%}) and (90.4{\%}, 91.4{\%}, 8.2{\%}, 7.6{\%}, 90.8{\%}, 91.7{\%}) respectively. {\textcopyright} 2018 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

In the category of tools and instruments, Fluke Corporation was the winner with its T6 Electric Tester. The instrument measures true RMS AC voltage without test leads. Officials said this saves time in the field, minimizes errors, and reduces the possibility of arc flash. Regal was the Innovation Award winner in the software category for its Browning Toolbox Technician Motor Efficiency Calculator for Apple and Android devices. The app allows users to identify efficiency differences between different generations of integral horsepower electric motors.},

abstract = {Activation of the pro-apoptotic BAX protein, a BCL-2 family member, is known to trigger apoptosis by forming pores in the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM). While in the cytosol, release of its transmembrane C-terminal helix (called $\alpha$9 helix) from a well-characterized binding pocket (BC groove) and subsequent permeabilization of the MOM are understood to be the initiating events of the activation. Concerning what initiates BAX activation, so far one plausible suggestion has been that the transient attachment of BH3-only peptide at a distal site from the BC groove triggers the activation process. Yet how this pivotal step displaces $\alpha$9 from the BC groove has remained poorly understood. Using a combination of standard molecular dynamics and enhanced sampling methods, the energy landscape of BIM (BH3-only peptide) induced BAX activation has been computed, and the molecular origin of those events is hereby reported in atomistic detail. The simulated transition pathway of $\alpha$9 release reveals that BIM subdues the energetic cost of the process by reducing the activation energy barrier to some extent but mostly by minimizing the free energy difference between the active ($\alpha$9-released) and inactive ($\alpha$9-bound) states. Interestingly, the flexibility of the $\alpha$9 helix itself plays a decisive role in this mechanism. The impact of BIM encounter at the distal site is found to propagate to the $\alpha$9 (BC groove bound) mostly through conserved pathways of residue level interactions. Overall, the thermodynamic basis of the "hit-and-run" mechanism for activation of the BCL-2 family is presented reconciling the available biochemical observations. {\textcopyright} 2017 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Self-inspection of buildings is the process of controlling the quality of construction work in order to ensure that the specifications are implemented according to the design. Under current practices, self-inspection is totally dependent on the operator's skills, being a process that can be time-consuming and sometimes difficult to achieve. The Intuitive Self-Inspection Techniques using Augmented Reality (INSITER; for construction, refurbishment and maintenance of energy-efficient buildings made of prefabricated components) project aims to develop a software tool to support construction workers in self-inspection processes, with the overall objective of reducing major errors and extra costs. Nevertheless, one of the challenges is the lack of interoperability between the various equipment used to carry out self-inspection. Devices and current tools deployed on-site do not speak the same language, which leads to a lack of communication. Therefore, this paper presents a framework under which the equipment would be able to send information in a common format. For this purpose, the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) de-facto standard has been established as a viable data model to represent all the information related to the building project. Along these lines, Building Information Modeling (BIM) information and IFC-compliant databases have been designed for the representation of data coming from Computer-Aided Design (CAD) modeling, laser scanning, thermography and sensor networks. Besides the IFC-data repositories, the framework is a multi-layer architecture with the goal of ensuring interoperability and promoting the stakeholders' objectives for self-inspection during the entire construction process. {\textcopyright} 2018 by the authors.},

abstract = {Building Information Modelling, new paradigm of digital design and management, shows great potential for the refurbishment process, as it represents a possible way out of criticalities that occur in documentation and preservation of existing assets, if connected to cognitive automation. The combination of BIM with automation systems improves the quality control during diagnosis, design and work execution, and the labour savings, which is particularly relevant for rapid intervention in case of hazardous conditions. Therefore, the paper is going to address a methodological discussion concerning complete “as-built” parametric models of historical buildings, supporting the design of refurbishment and conservation interventions. Although some reviews of the state of the art exist on the topic of Historic Building Information Modelling, the present research introduces a different perspective on HBIM modelling, with diagnosis and performance assessment as key-aspects, in terms of automating performance assessment. Specifically, from the data collection of contributions regarding HBIM/BIM, diagnostics and monitoring on existing buildings and infrastructures, a critical review by selected criteria is developed. Nevertheless, general methods and tools for information management and exchange tasks in BIM are briefly described as well, since they are considered useful for future developments of HBIM approach. The core of the critical analysis is focused on the scientific and technical relations among HBIM models, diagnosis and performance assessment features. In addition, the review identifies specific activities and relative tools and methods for knowledge acquisition and semantic enrichment. Finally, gaps in knowledge of the current literature are outlined and discussed, with specific focus on performance assessment in HBIM. In this regard, a new methodology toward Diagnosis-Aided Historic Building Information Modelling and Management (DA-HBIMM) is proposed as a framework to be developed in order to address smart knowledge acquisition, collection and notification of assessed performances and eventual risks, by cognitive automation and artificial intelligence, in the near future. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {To transform the existing energy systems towards renewable energy sources, buildings need to use less energy, use energy more efficiently and harness local renewable energy sources. For the design of energy-efficient buildings, building energy simulation of varying sophistication is commonly employed. Types of simulations range from simple, static calculations to sophisticated dynamic simulation. Especially for building retrofit many assumptions on construction, material etc. have to be taken, which increases the uncertainty of simulation results. In conjunction with simulation, methods of Building Performance Optimization are increasingly employed. They are able to identify best performing designs however do not provide insights on the mechanisms and interdependencies of the different design factors, which are most valuable to make informed design decisions. We present a methodology that aims to provide a better understanding and create knowledge about the influence and interactions of different architectural and technical design factors on building energy performance of a specific design task. For this purpose, we introduce Design of Experiments (DoE) in an integrated design workflow using the Design Performance Viewer (DPV) toolset, combining Building Information Modeling (BIM), distributed dynamic simulation and statistical analysis of the extensive simulation results. The experiments created using the methodology allow to identify the strength of effects and interactions of different design factors on selected performance indicators. We apply the methodology on an office retrofit case, introducing a factor scatterplot for result visualization, development and comparison of retrofit strategies. We further evaluate its potential to identify high performing strategies while balancing architectural and technical factors and their impact on energy performance. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

Currently, the long-lived luminescence emission of such inorganic-organic hybrids is dominantly confined to short-wavelength regions. The long-wavelength long-lived luminescence emission, however, has been rarely reported for MOFs. In this work, a series of structurally stable long-wavelength long-lived luminescent MOFs have been successfully synthesized by encapsulating different dyes into the green phosphorescent MOFs Cd(m-BDC)(BIM). The multicolor long-wavelength long-lived luminescence emissions (ranging from green to red) in dye-encapsulated MOFs are achieved by the MOF-to-dye phosphorescence energy transfer. Furthermore, the promising optical properties of these novel long-lived luminescent MOFs allow them to be used as ink pads for advanced anticounterfeiting stamps. Therefore, this work not only offers a facile way to develop new types of multicolor long-lived luminescent materials but also provides a reference for the development of advanced long-lived luminescent anticounterfeiting materials. {\textcopyright} 2017 American Chemical Society.},

Building Information Modelling (BIM) is expected to promote more efficient buildings through evaluation of different design options. BIM can be used as a platform from which to gather information that can be conveyed to energy efficiency simulation tools. The objective of this paper was to implement the model of a reversible air-to-water heat pump in EnergyPlus 8.9. This model was employed to analyze the performance of an aerothermal heat pump system (B) in a residential building under different Spanish climates compared to a conventional Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system (A). Significant primary energy savings were achieved with system B compared to system A. These energy savings were higher in climates with a significant heating demand such as Madrid (27.4{\%}) and Burgos (33.6{\%}), and in cities with a mild climate such as Barcelona (37{\%}). The residential building studied in this work was classified as Class A according to the CO2 emissions scale when using the aerothermal heat pump system, and as Class B when using the conventional HVAC system. {\textcopyright} 2018 by the authors.

abstract = {Design choices with a unilateral focus on the reduction of operational energy for developing energy-efficient and near-zero energy building practices can increase the impact of the embodied energy, as there is a trade-off between embodied and operational energy. Multi-objective optimization approaches enable exploration of the trade-off problems to find sustainable design strategies, but there has been limited research in applying it to find optimal design solution(s) considering the embodied versus operational energy trade-off. Additionally, integration of this approach into a Building Information Modeling (BIM) for facilitating set up of the building model toward optimization and utilizing the benefits of BIM for sharing information in an interoperable and reusable manner, has been mostly overlooked. To address these issues, this paper presents a framework that supports the making of appropriate design decisions by solving the trade-off problem between embodied and operational energy through the integration of a multi-objective optimization approach with a BIM-driven design process. The applicability of the framework was tested by developing a prototype and using it in a case study of a low energy dwelling in Sweden, which showed the potential for reducing the building's Life Cycle Energy (LCE) use by accounting for the embodied versus operational energy trade-off to find optimal design solution(s). In general, the results of the case study demonstrated that in a low energy dwelling, depending on the site location, small reductions in operational energy (i.e. 140 GJ) could result in larger increases in embodied energy (i.e. 340 GJ) and the optimization process could yield up to 108 GJ of LCE savings relative to the initial design. This energy saving was equivalent to up to 8 years of the initial design's operational energy use for the dwelling, excluding household electricity use. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

The main goal is analysing and testing the feasibility of municipal waste reuse for designing building envelopes for Near Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB), so as to contribute to the decreasing demand for energy and improve eco-friendly waste management in urban areas. First, prefab building components have been designed using selected waste and their thermal and acoustic behaviours have been calculated, according to the European rules; then the economic costs of the obtained building envelopes have been assessed and compared to common building structures to verify their possible appeal on the Italian market, and finally the components have been assembled in the project for a small NZEB building: A didactic classroom for the Mira Porte Primary School (Venice, Italy). This paper refers to the in-depth elaboration of the project, mainly concerning fire and pollutant protection, and it focuses on the reliability check of the Building Information Modeling (BIM) parametric model, especially as concerns non-conventional materials and components. The relative building energy behaviour has been obtained exporting the BIM energy simulation model using the EC770 Integrated Design for Revit plug-in. Finally, a comparison between the results obtained with the traditional energy assessment (according to D.M. 26/06/2015) and those using the BIM model has been made to evaluate the interoperability between architectural modeling software and the energy simulation one. {\textcopyright} 2018 WIT Press.},

abstract = {In this paper we introduce a method that supports the detection, identification and localization of lamps in a building, with the main goal of automatically feeding its energy model by means of Building Information Modeling (BIM) methods. The proposed method, thus, provides useful information to apply energy-saving strategies to reduce energy consumption in the building sector through the correct management of the lighting infrastructure. Based on the unique geometry and brightness of lamps and the use of only greyscale images, our methodology is able to obtain accurate results despite its low computational needs, resulting in near-real-time processing. The main novelty is that the focus of the candidate search is not over the entire image but instead only on a limited region that summarizes the specific characteristics of the lamp. The information obtained from our approach was used on the Green Building XML Schema to illustrate the automatic generation of BIM data from the results of the algorithm. {\textcopyright} 2017},

Many of the discoveries in this field have recently been incorporated into mandatory construction regulations for each country. However, not many of the architects and engineers involved in the construction industry clearly know how to achieve those goals in their designs. This document is based on the extensive experience in architectural design, the integration of renewable energies, the energy simulation of buildings and data acquisition, and analysis of the research team involved. It is presented in a practical and holistic approach and focused in subtropical climates. A structured methodology for the proper decision-making process during all the different stages of a minimum energy building (MEB) is likewise presented. The proposed methodology depicted aims at providing architects and engineers with a systematic and orderly step-by-step procedure and incorporates the instrumentation/control and data analysis as essential elements that support the validation of the expected results from the design, the construction, and the operation phase of the building. The paper develops a case study that illustrates the proposed methodology. This new methodology for MEB in subtropical climates constitutes an innovation in this field. {\textcopyright} 2018 by the authors.},

abstract = {As we advance towards high-performance buildings, it is becoming necessary to reinforce and extend the role of building information modelling (BIM) to better support performance-based design. To achieve an optimally functioning building that fulfils the need of the end-user and is designed in an environmentally conscious manner necessitates considering energy performance, environmental performance, indoor air quality, lighting, and acoustics. To consider these multiple criteria, use of computer-based modelling tools and comprehensive simulation methods becomes essential. These criteria are typically assessed after the main phases of architectural design of the building, and the knowledge is passed on to the engineers for development of the technical design. During the technical design process, the exchange of data between the design model and a selected building performance aspect may occur. This paper investigates the potential of BIM-based models at the core of providing input data required for performance-based simulations (BPS) to enable iterative multi-criteria assessment towards high performance buildings. A comprehensive literature review of 249 documents was conducted to identify the current state of knowledge and provide future directions for design and simulation tools to better quantify and evaluate the performance aspects. Furthermore, it explains and clarifies stakeholders' current ability, needs, barriers, and potentials in using BIM for assessing building performance through nineteen expert interviews of key BIM stakeholders in Finland. {\textcopyright} 2018 The author(s).},

Research field is massive housing up to 23 floors, 400 dwellings per building and different housing layouts- to be evaluated for potential retrofitting at the dwelling level. IBM for massive housing built with IMS construction technology represents an integration of systems' components into hierarchy assemblies by simple joints. IMS Building Technology by IMS Institute is the system for high-rise structures with prefabricated elements of the skeleton. In order to assess the current situation regarding the selection and implementation of energy savings measures and the role of industrialized technology in supporting the rehabilitation of post-war housing in Belgrade-building configuration model and IMS construction technology has been analyzed, providing in-depth information on the way building components and systems are put together into IBM. In which way retrofit may be approached? IBM is represented with graph model (GM) diagram to describe a number of value-added processes according to independent systems/components and flexible connections. This paper highlights the technological aspects of "open" prefabrication industry and building with the systems that should be assessed in the future retrofitting of massive housing based on industrialization and energy efficiency. The paper proposes an IBM that provides concrete description of massive housing buildings, the requirements for information to be provided to approving refurbishment processes. The research also addresses both: challenges as well as opportunities for advancing Building Information Modeling (BIM) standards in off-site re-construction of massive housing with new "infill" industry. {\textcopyright} 2018 by the authors.

New developments, such as the increased influence of the building construction for LCA and the forthcoming of building information modeling (BIM), implicate new requirements on multiscale levels of development and complexity for LCA construction databases. At the example of the German "{\"{o}}kobau.dat", one of the leading LCA construction databases, this publication discusses whether the database is able to meet these requirements. The analysis shows the strengths of the {\"{o}}kobau.dat with regard to standardization conformity (EN 15804, ILCD), data provision in machine-readable XML format, and the provision of an application programming interface. Shortcomings include incorrect linking of building life cycle inventory data with environmental information, incorrect documentation of functional units, missing generic datasets, the modeling of energy use data or the lack of a uniform structuring, or material classification. The authors propose solutions such as the provision of appropriate functional units, the implementation of a top-down approach to investigate the completeness of data based on existing nomenclatures or the extension with an appropriate material classification.

The same modeling approach is applied to model aggregate hourly district heat consumption in three different consumer groups located in Oslo. A comparison of modeled and metered hourly energy consumption shows that hourly variations and aggregate consumption per county and year are reproduced well by the models. However, for some smaller regions, modeled annual electricity consumption is over- or underestimated by more than 20{\%}. Our results indicate that the presented method is useful for modeling the current and future hourly energy consumption of a regional building stock, but that larger and more detailed training datasets are required to improve the models, and more detailed building stock statistics on regional level are needed to generate useful estimates on aggregate regional energy consumption. {\textcopyright} 2018 by the authors.},

Structurally, the intimate interfacial contact between the 3D CdS NW scaffold and the discrete CBP microstructures benefits their strong electronic interaction and efficient charge separation. Upon simultaneous light excitation, a tandem solid-state electron flow from CdS to CBP and then from metal (Co) to ligand (bIm) precisely catalyzes the reduction of pre-activated H atoms on the bIm ligands for efficient H2 evolution. {\textcopyright} 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract = {Building energy efficiency is a major issue related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. It is also an important part of energy conservation. At present, China is in the rapid development stage of industrialization and urbanization. The growth of industry, the accelerated process of urbanization, and the upgrading of the consumption structure of the residents make us more urgent to the demand for energy and economic resources. In the field of construction, the proportion of building energy consumption in the whole society has risen from 10{\%} in 1978 to 30{\%}. The energy consumption per unit building area is more than 2-3 times more than that of the developed countries, which is more than the sum of all developed countries. It has become the second largest energy consumption country in the world. It can be seen that building energy efficiency has reached the point where it cannot be grabbed. What is building energy conservation? Building energy conservation refers to the implementation of energy saving standards in the planning, design, construction, reconstruction and use of buildings, the use of energy-saving technologies, processes, equipment, materials and products, to improve the thermal insulation performance and the efficiency of heating and heating system, and to strengthen the efficiency of the heating system of air conditioning and refrigeration. On the premise of ensuring the quality of indoor thermal environment, the energy consumption of heating and air conditioning, lighting and hot water supply can be reduced by the use of renewable energy. {\textcopyright} Indian Pulp and Paper Technical Association.

abstract = {Xenon/krypton (Xe/Kr) separation is of industrial importance. Environmental concerns exist for pure noble-gas production and the reprocessing of noble-gas radioisotopes from used nuclear fuel. Cryogenic distillation as the main technology for Xe/Kr separation is energy and capital intensive. Thus, the development of a more economical and energy-efficient alternative, such as adsorptive separation based on solid porous materials, is urgent and significant. Herein, we prepared metal-organic-framework derived nanoporous carbons as new promising porous materials for highly selective Xe/Kr separation. A series of metal-organic-framework (MOF) derived nanoporous carbons (Z11CB-700, Z11CB-800, Z11CB-900, Z11CB-1000, Z11CB-1100, Z11CBF-1000-1, Z11CBF-1000-2 and Z11CBF-1000-3) were synthesized with ZIF-11 ([Zn(bIM)2], HbIM = benziminazole) as a precursor and furfuryl alcohol as an optional carbon source. A systematic investigation of the Xe/Kr separation was performed on these nanoporous carbons, and they were compared with commercial activated carbon. Z11CBF-1000-2 shows significantly high Xe Henry coefficient (80.01 mmol g-1 bar-1) and high thermodynamic Xe/Kr selectivity (19.7) at very low partial pressures relevant to nuclear-fuel reprocessing. Single-column breakthrough experiments indicate that the Z11CBF-1000-2 exhibits benchmark Xe capacity (20.6 mmol kg-1) under dynamic dilute conditions, which implies its promising potential to capture and separate Xe in used nuclear-fuel reprocessing facilities. {\textcopyright} The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

However, the high costs and low yields of the synthetic methods for 2D MOFs are major obstacles for the preparation of 2D carbon materials from 2D MOFs. Herein, we report a facile and low-cost bottom-up synthesis of ultrathin Zn(bim)(OAc) MOF nanosheets (with a thickness of ∼5 nm and a high yield of ∼65{\%}) and their derived N-doped porous ultrathin (2.5 ± 0.8 nm) carbon nanosheets (UT-CNSs) for energy storage. The UT-CNSs exhibit a capacitance of 278 F g-1 at a high current density of 10 A g-1, which is the highest among the reported MOF-derived carbon materials for supercapacitor electrodes. In addition, the UT-CNSs also exhibit a high reversible capacity of 553 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1 and retain 100{\%} coulombic efficiency after 1000 cycles at 2 A g-1 as an anode material for lithium ion batteries. The superior electrochemical properties of the UT-CNSs, especially at high current densities, are mainly due to their ultrathin morphology, large specific surface area, high conductivity, and suitable porous structure. This work provides a new strategy for the high-yield and low-cost synthesis of ultrathin MOF nanosheets as well as 2D carbon materials and their metal or metal oxide composites for various applications. {\textcopyright} 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract = {Manufacturing is a competitive global market and efforts to mitigate climate change are at the forefront of public perception. Current trends in manufacturing aim to reduce costs and increase sustainability without negatively affecting the yield of finished products, thus maintaining or improving profits. Effective use of energy within a manufacturing environment can help in this regard by lowering overhead costs. Significant benefit can be gained by utilising simulations in order to predict energy demand allowing companies to make effective retrofit decisions based on energy as well as other metrics such as resource use, throughput and overhead costs. Traditionally, Building Energy Modelling (BEM) and Manufacturing Process Simulation (MPS) have been used extensively in their respective fields but they remain separate and segregated which limits the simulation window used to identify energy improvements. This review details modelling approaches and the simulation tools that have been used, or are available, in an attempt to combine BEM and MPS, or elements from each, into a holistic approach. Such an approach would be able to simulate the interdependencies of multiple layers contained within a factory from production machines, process lines and Technical Building Services (TBS) to the building shell. Thus achieving a greater perspective for identifying energy improvement measures across the entire operating spectrum and multiple, if not all, manufacturing industries. In doing so the challenges associated with incorporating BEM in manufacturing simulation are highlighted as well as gaps within the research for exploitation through future research. This paper identified requirements for the development of a holistic energy simulation tool for use in a manufacturing facility, that is capable of simulating interdependencies between different building layers and systems, and a rapid method of 3D building geometry generation from site data or existing BIM in an appropriate format for energy simulations of existing factory buildings. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Purpose: Green building construction was adopted as a strategy to reduce energy consumption and the overall impact of the built environment on our natural environment. However, in Malaysia, previous studies have reaffirmed that green office buildings consume a substantial amount of energy, compared to their counterparts in Singapore. Moreover, there is still a significant performance gap between predicted energy measurements and actual operational energy consumption of green office buildings in Malaysia, due to occupants' behavioural discrepancies. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to develop energy efficiency practices for occupants of green office buildings in Malaysia. The developed practices integrate technology, organisation policy, and occupants' behavioural strategies, in order to reduce the energy consumption of green office buildings in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve the research goal, a mixed (quantitative and qualitative) research method was used to collect data from the research population. In total, 53 respondents working in a green office building complex in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia were surveyed using a questionnaire. Additionally, three top management staff of the green office building and two Malaysian construction professionals were interviewed. The study adopted convenience sampling technique in selecting the research respondents. The data from the questionnaire were analysed using SPSS software (version 22) while the interview data were analysed via thematic content analysis. Findings: The findings suggest that the integration of technological strategy (use of BIM tools, sustainable building materials, etc.); organisational strategy (develop, implement and evaluate action plans, use of monitor/control systems, etc.); and occupants behavioural strategy (training, incentives, occupants energy efficiency guide, etc.) will critically reduce energy consumption of green office buildings in Malaysia. Originality/value: Based on the findings, energy efficiency practices are developed to guide occupants in reducing the energy consumption of green office buildings in Malaysia. This strategy will contribute to reducing the performance gap that exists between predicted energy and actual energy use of green office buildings in Malaysia. However, the developed energy efficiency practices need to be validated to ascertain its workability in the green office building context. {\textcopyright} 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Accordingly, the benchmark EUI values, building data, and population data were used as input parameters to derive a convenient equation for predicting energy consumption in each grid of the urban energy use maps. A comparison of the measured and predicted energy consumptions confirmed the precision of this equation. To sum up, relevant data are readily available and can be exploited to prepare urban energy use maps for other large cities in Taiwan.

abstract = {Background: Lighting simulation tools are extending the functionality of Building Information Modeling (BIM) authoring software applications to support the lighting design analysis of buildings. Although such tools enable quantitative and qualitative analysis and visualization of indoor lighting, they do not provide an interactive environment between users and the design context. Moreover, their visualization environments do not allow users to experience visual phenomena such as glare. In addition, lighting energy consumption generated from traditional tools is often separated from the 3D virtual context of the building. Therefore, an incorrect interpretation by designers regarding the relationship between their desirable lighting design and energy feedback may occur. Methods: This research proposes a method and develops a BIM-based lighting design feedback (BLDF) prototype system for realistic visualization of lighting condition and the calculation of energy consumption. Results: The results of a case study revealed that BLDF supports design stakeholders to better perceive and optimize lighting conditions in order to achieve a higher degree of satisfaction in terms of lighting design and energy savings for future occupants. Conclusions: The developed system utilizes an interactive and immersive virtual reality (VR) environment to simulate daylighting and the illumination of artificial lights in buildings and visualizes realistic VR scenes using head mounted displays (HMD). BLDF allows users to interact with design objects, to change them, and to compare multiple design scenarios, and provides real-time lighting quality and energy consumption feedback. {\textcopyright} 2017, The Author(s).},

abstract = {Modern commercial buildings' resource consumption is metered at various levels of spatial and temporal resolution to track and reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. However, not all data that could be used to detect faults or identify efficiency improvements are available due to the cost of meters and inaccessibility of the data they produce. In the field of building operation, building performance simulation (BPS) can help in quantifying unmeasured energy flows, for instance solar gains, heat loss from infiltration, etc. Furthermore, integrating building information modeling (BIM) in building operation and maintenance can decrease operation risk and costs, as well as maintain facility management quality. However, in practice there is a lack of efficient utilization of this application by building operators. The aim of this paper is to provide an integrated framework to estimate and visualize energy flows and the associated cost. The framework consists of 1) developing a BIM model, 2) converting the BIM model to a BPS model, 3) calibrating the model, and 4) visualizing energy and cost flows using Sankey diagrams. The study demonstrates this framework on a real-world case study, and hence provides a comprehensive energy use assessment on the building level to facilitate the decision-making by building operators. Finally, the results of a survey that was deployed to a sample user group to assess the usability and effectiveness of the proposed Sankey diagrams are provided. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Background: Technological developments and globalized working processes have transformed the building process. However, current digital semantic building models no longer adequately represent the increasing complexity of modern building projects. The potential of combining agent-based and graph-based methods, for example for energy calculations or spatial research strategies, is not fully exploited. Methods: In our system, users search for building floorplans, for example as sources of inspiration, by creating conceptual hand-drawn sketches of building parts on multi-touch devices. The sketch is analyzed and used to query a federated database system comprising a building information model server, the graph database neo4j and the content management system mediaTUM. Users interact with client applications that show and continuously update a list of floorplans by sending queries to a central coordinator service. In the paper, we describe the coordinator that enables our databases to appear as a single smart information system to search for digital information about buildings and visualize their floorplans. The application case comprises search by drawing the initial design idea of a building to find similar floorplans e.g. as source of inspiration. Results: Our federated database system is queried using semantic building floorplan fingerprints, which are formalized as graphs and encoded in a common schema, like our AGraphML, to represent spatial configurations and perform graph matching. As graph matching is computationally expensive, the coordinator needs to analyze the queries, separate different fingerprints and metadata and pass it to specialized agents, implemented as microservices, for processing. The returned result sets are combined and the results are visualized. The use of multiple agents facilitates the recombination of the data from the underlying disparate data sources and also serves to support different execution strategies which are chosen using properties of the query and a set of predefined rules. Conclusions: To deal with complex and dynamic queries, as well as dynamic results that are updated while some agents are still executing, a caching framework was developed which takes the similarity measures of the graph-based building representation into account when determining query equality. {\textcopyright} 2017, The Author(s).},

abstract = {This paper presents the evaluation of the level of usability of an intelligent monitoring and control interface for energy efficient management of public buildings, called BuildVis, which forms part of a Building Energy Management System (BEMS.) The BEMS ‘intelligence' is derived from an intelligent algorithm component which brings together ANN-GA rule generation, a fuzzy rule selection engine, and a semantic knowledge base. The knowledge base makes use of linked data and an integrated ontology to uplift heterogeneous data sources relevant to building energy consumption. The developed ontology is based upon the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), which is a Building Information Modelling (BIM) standard and consists of two different types of rule model to control and manage the buildings adaptively. The populated rules are a mix of an intelligent rule generation approach using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Genetic Algorithms (GA), and also data mining rules using Decision Tree techniques on historical data. The resulting rules are triggered by the intelligent controller, which processes available sensor measurements in the building. This generates ‘suggestions' which are presented to the Facility Manager (FM) on the BuildVis web-based interface. BuildVis uses HTML5 innovations to visualise a 3D interactive model of the building that is accessible over a wide range of desktop and mobile platforms. The suggestions are presented on a zone by zone basis, alerting them to potential energy saving actions. As the usability of the system is seen as a key determinate to success, the paper evaluates the level of usability for both a set of technical users and also the FMs for five European buildings, providing analysis and lessons learned from the approach taken. {\textcopyright} 2017},

abstract = {This paper explores the potential for using remotely sensed data from a combination of commercial and open-sources, to improve the functionality, accuracy of energy-use calculations and visualisation of carbon emissions. We present a study demonstrating the use of LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) data and aerial imagery for a mixed-use inner urban area within the North East of England and how this can improve the quality of input data for modelling standardised energy uses and carbon emissions. We explore the scope of possible input data for both (1) building geometry and (2) building physics models from these sources. We explain the significance of improved data accuracy for the assessment of heat-loss parameters, orientation, and shading and renewable energy micro-generation. We also highlight the limitations around the sole use of remotely sensed data and how these concerns can be partially addressed through combinations with (1) open-source property data, such as age, occupancy, tenure and (2) existing stakeholder data sets, including building services and measured performance. We set out some of the technical challenges; addressed through data approximation (considering data quality and metadata protocols) and a combination of automated or manual processing; in the use, adaptation, and transferability of this data. We elucidate how the output can be visualised and be supported by many of industry-standard CAD, GIS, and BIM software applications hence, broadening the scope for real-world applications. We demonstrate the support of commercial interest and potential drawing evidence from primary market research regarding the principal applications, functionality, and output. In summary, we conclude on the benefits in the use of remotely sensed data for improved accuracy in energy use and carbon emission calculations, the need for semantic integration of mixed data sources and the importance of output visualisation. {\textcopyright} 2017, The Author(s).},

abstract = {Mcl-1, which is an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family, is overexpressed in various cancers and promotes the aberrant survival of tumor cells. To inhibit Mcl-1, and initiate apoptosis, an interaction between BH3-only proteins and Mcl-1 anti-apoptotic protein is necessary. These protein-protein interactions exhibit some selectivity: Mcl-1 binds specifically to Noxa, whereas Bim and Puma bind strongly to all anti-apoptotic proteins. Even if the three-dimensional (3D) structures of several Mcl-1/BH3-only complexes have been solved, the BH3-only binding specificity to Mcl-1 is still not completely understood. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations were used to elucidate the molecular basis of the interactions with Mcl-1. Our results corroborate the importance of four conserved hydrophobic residues and a conserved aspartic acid on BH3-only as a common binding pattern. Furthermore, our results highlight the contribution of the fifth hydrophobic residue in the C-terminal part and a negatively charged patch in the N-terminal of BH3-only peptides as important for their fixation to Mcl-1. We hypothesize that this negatively charged patch will be an Mcl-1 specific binding pattern. {\textcopyright} 2017 American Chemical Society.},

@article{Maurer2017467,
abstract = {Based on an analysis of building processes to date, this paper proposes two ways to make Building Information Modelling (BIM) and with it complex building processes less expensive and more reliable. First, existing experience with building processes that include building-integrated solar systems is analysed, as they are one example for buildings with high energy-saving goals. Based on the analysis, the authors propose to include a new property set and functions in machine code in the next version of the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC). For the machine-code functions, several formats are proposed and the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed IFC extensions are discussed. For simple conventional building components, the existing IFC version 4 seems appropriate. Buildings with innovations that add complexity to the building process can profit most by the savings generated by exchanging machine-code functions. In building processes to date, much information is not shared because of proprietary matters. Functions in machine code can provide the necessary confidentiality so that more capabilities can be exchanged between the stakeholders. Models based on machine-code functions can be updated much faster than detailed models with many parameters. With machine-code functions, advantage can be taken of the greater accuracy of detailed models, as long as they are fast and easy to use. The modularity of the functions stimulates competition between alternative approaches, which makes simulation models less expensive. Finally, exchanging a closed, validated simulation model in machine code introduces a much lower risk of error than exporting and importing complex simulation models. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In the context of environmental policy, the EU has launched a series of initiatives aimed at increasing the use of energy efficiency, as it has pledged to reduce energy consumption by 20{\%}, compared with projected levels of growth of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere by 2020. In Greece CO2 emission levels in the atmosphere have risen significantly over the past two decades [1]. For the year 2011, CO2 emissions per person in Greece correspond to 7.56 t. According to the data, this increase in emissions is reflected to a 151.2{\%} above from the levels of 1980 and a 756{\%} increase from 1960 levels. The building sector consumes the largest amount of energy in Greece, therefore constitutes the most important source of CO2 emissions. The energy upgrade of the building sector produces multiple benefits such as reduced energy consumption, which is consistent with the reduction of air pollution. Additionally, there is a significant improvement at the interior comfort conditions of the building, which promotes productivity and occupant health. Moreover, because of the large number of educational buildings in the country, the energy consumption of them present a significant amount of the country's total energy consumption and simultaneously has the effect of increasing the costs paid by the state budget for the operation and maintenance of public buildings. The investigation of alternative methods to reduce energy consumption in educational buildings is an important approach for sustainability and economic development of the country over time. The purpose of this paper is to study and evaluate the energy saving methods of a university building in Mediterranean climate with significant energy consumption. Additionally, through Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software, studies considering the contribution of passive heating and cooling techniques were conducted, in order to minimize energy consumption in pursuit of desirable interior thermal comfort conditions. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In ventilation systems a considerable amount of energy is used for mass transport of conditioned air to provide the requested volume flows. Reducing volume flow while maintaining indoor air quality has leverage on energy efficiency and is commonly known as Demand Controlled Ventilation (DCV). Current implementations require Variable Air Volume (VAV) controllers to provide a defined volume flow to each room. The controllers measure the pressure difference and adjust the motor flap accordingly. This paper examines an approach that achieves DCV, but replaces the VAV-boxes with simple motor flaps. The missing pressure-drop measurements that allow calculating the volume flow are substituted by a model of the ventilation system. The authors develop a method for calculating the pressure drop in the ducts of a ventilation system that regards the topology and the components of the duct system. This model is coupled with a model for the CO2 concentration in the rooms for all conditioned rooms in order to derive the required air volume flow. Using this model, a linear controller is developed that operates the ventilation system. It is shown that the presented approach operates the ventilation more efficiently, while maintaining comfort constraints and saving installation costs. The modeling effort of the current approach is expected to be reduced with the introduction of the Building Information Model (BIM) into building operation. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Although a large number of studies on Building Information Modeling (BIM) have been conducted in the past decade, a lack of consensus remains among researchers and practitioners regarding the applications of BIM for the development of green buildings, the activity of making buildings in a way that protects the natural environment. As the usefulness of BIM has been widely recognized in the building and construction industry, there is an urgent need to establish an up-to-date synthesis on the nexus between BIM and green buildings. After an in-depth review of hundreds of journal articles published from 1999 to 2016 and 12 widely used types of BIM software, this study provides a holistic understanding and critical reflection on the nexus between BIM and green buildings, which is systematically illustrated by a “Green BIM Triangle” taxonomy. The proposed taxonomy indicates that the nexus between BIM and green buildings needs to be understood based on three dimensions, namely project phases, green attributes and BIM attributes. Following the proposed taxonomy, this paper systematically illustrated 1) the applications of BIM in supporting the design, construction, operation, and retrofitting processes of green buildings; 2) the various functions of BIM for green building analyses such as energy, emissions, and ventilation analysis; 3) the applications of BIM in supporting green building assessments (GBA); and 4) research gaps and future research directions in this area. Through critical review and synthesis of BIM and green buildings based on evidence from both academic research and industrial practices, this paper provides important guidance for building researchers and practitioners to better align BIM development with green building development in the future. {\textcopyright} 2017},

In detail, these requirements refer to storing the large amounts of data that the AEC industry generates — from building schematics to associated data derived from different contractors that are involved at various stages of the building lifecycle; or running simulations on building models (such as energy efficiency, environmental impact {\&} occupancy simulations). Creating such a computing infrastructure to support operations deriving from various AEC projects can be challenging due to the complexity of workflows, distributed nature of the data and diversity of roles, profiles and location of the users. Federated clouds have provided the means to create a distributed environment that can support multiple individuals and organisations to work collaboratively. In this study we present how multi-site construction projects can be coordinated by the use of federated clouds where the interacting parties are represented by AEC industry organisations. We show how coordination can support (a) data sharing and interoperability using a multi-vendor Cloud environment and (b) process interoperability based on various stakeholders involved in the AEC project lifecycle. We develop a framework that facilitates project coordination with associated “issue status” implications and validate our outcome in a real construction project. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

The new concepts of an integrated design team, building information modeling, commissioning of the building enclosure, and passive house standards have reached maturity. Global work on development of new construction materials has not changed, but their evaluation is not the same as in the past when each material was considered on its own merits. Today, we look at the performance of a building as a system and on the material as a contributor to this system. The series of white papers—a research overview in building physics undertaken in European and North American researchers—is to provide understanding of the process of design and construction for sustainable built environment that involves harmony between different aspects of the environment, society, and economy. Yet, the building physics is changing. It merges with building science in the quest of predicting building performance, it merges concepts of passive houses with solar engineering and integrates building shell with mechanical services, but is still missing an overall vision. Physics does not tell us how to integrate people with their environment. The authors propose a new term buildings with environmental quality management because the vision of the building design must be re-directed toward people. In doing so, the building physics will automatically include durability of the shell, energy efficiency, and carbon emission and aspects such as individual ventilation and indoor climate control.

abstract = {The burden of the European construction and building sector on the natural environment is apparent from the data, which reveal the energy, materials, and water consumption, and the waste generation associated with the building sector. Yet, significant efforts in improving the environmental awareness and sustainability of the construction sector are arising through the introduction of the numerous regulations, directives, and initiatives. This review work provides an overview of the most relevant existing European policies and legislation for the built environment, and the construction materials in particular. The implementation of a comparative assessment against the key elements of the international legislation and efforts enables the definition of the responsiveness of the EU in enacting policies that ensure the environmental sustainability of the sector, as well as identifies prospects for further improvement. Working towards the increase of the sustainability of the construction sector in a framework of holistic life cycle considerations is promoted in the current legislation, where identifying opportunities for energy and cost savings, utilizing natural resources efficiently and achieving waste minimization is endorsed. This work can be exploited from both policy- makers and the scientific community as guidance for transforming in a truly green sustainable construction market. The conclusions of this work indicate that the sustainability of the built environment will come through the increased use of alternative, recycled, natural and unconventional construction materials and thermal insulation materials, the exploitation of prefabricated building elements, the integration of LCA with BIM, the employment of multi- objective optimization methodologies, and the development of country- specific data for the implementation of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies. These fields, as well as other factors such as globilisation and government intervention, are critical for fulfilling the vision of the European Union (EU) and will require systematic approach for their incorporation in the relevant policies to be developed and introduced in the near future. {\textcopyright} 2017},

abstract = {As Building Information Modeling evolves into becoming the central mean for coordinating project design and planning activities, we notice a few limitations/opportunities in the way current BIM tools address the needs for integrated design, collaboration and analysis (the initial objective of BIM). First, substantial communications and interactions about the design exist outside the BIM environment — typically in e-mail formats. This may cause distractions, delays to the project, and could waste valuable knowledge (contained in these interactions). Second, the need of engaging end-users and their keen interest in selecting “green” features. Professionals can develop different designs that achieve varying levels of energy conservation, but these will always require changes based on usage patterns. So, it is important that end-users are involved in the design process early on to make sure that they receive adequate information/ education before they make decisions. This is the nature of limitations that we try to address in this research. This paper builds around the design and development of an online system, named Green2.0 that tries to leverage advancements in Building Information Models (BIM), energy-efficiency simulation tools, and online social network analysis methods to enable a data-driven approach to building planning, construction and maintenance. Fundamentally, it allows participants (end-users or professionals) to comment and share views about building designs. Social network analysis and semantic modeling tools are then used to extract information from these interactions. At the same time, it connects BIM to energy analysis software to allow users to select different products from a catalog and assess the impact of each on energy consumption. The platform aims to advance the current state of the art by bringing about a fundamental shift in the way that AEC professionals, end-users and public policy makers work together throughout a building's lifecycle. Designed as an open platform, it provides access to information that enables researchers and practitioners to build new, more efficient theories and methods of building design. The premise of our work is that by providing new insights into the building design process it is likely to have a profound beneficial effect for both AEC professionals and the society at large. {\textcopyright} 2017},

abstract = {In order to reduce the amount of energy being spent in the construction industry and to achieve the EU Climate and Energy Package goals by 2020, new ways of constructing houses is required. This research proposes construction of bio-based nearly zero energy or passive houses as one solution. Typical house construction methods in the Balkan region are analysed and compared to current Austrian house construction methods (in particular straw bale house built to passive house standards), since Austria is now one of the leading countries in Europe when it comes to offering smart and eco-friendly construction methods. This paper aims to enhance the understanding of the environmental performance of straw bale house in the Balkan region, develop the mainstream acceptance and use of straw as a construction material by proving that, such home is not only healthier for the environment, but also economically justifiable to construct than concrete/brick homes usually built in this region of the world. This is done via energy analysis in both BIM and Baubook software and construction cost calculation and comparison of two different house types virtually placed in Bosnia and Herzegovina as a representative country of Balkan region. Type 1 is bio-based house, while Type 2 is concrete house of similar geometry. During the analysis, it was discovered that Type 1 house is in compliance with passive house standards, while Type 2 isn't. Furthermore, energy use intensity according to BIM analysis for Type 1 is half of the value of the Type 2 house. Peak heating load for Type 2 house is much larger than for the Type 1 house. Global warming potential of Type 1 house is negative, which means that bio-based materials absorb CO2 during its life. Global warming potential for Type 2 is 435.02 kgCO2/m2. In addition to this, it costs slightly less to construct Type 1 house than Type 2 house. Therefore, this paper proves that Type 1 – Bio-based house is cheaper to construct and more energy efficient than Type 2 – Concrete house that is typically being constructed in the Balkan region. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Such strategies have managed to improve current practices in managing buildings, however decarbonizing the built environment and reducing the energy performance gap remains a complex undertaking that requires more comprehensive and sustainable solutions. In this context, building information modelling (BIM), can help the sustainability agenda as the digitalization of product and process information provides a unique opportunity to optimize energy-efficiency-related decisions across the entire lifecycle and supply chain. BIM is foreseen as a means to waste and emissions reduction, performance gap minimization, in-use energy enhancements, and total lifecycle assessment. It also targets the whole supply chain related to design, construction, as well as management and use of facilities, at the different qualifications levels (including blue-collar workers). In this paper, we present how building information modelling can be utilized to address energy efficiency in buildings in the operation phase, greatly contributing to achieving carbon emissions targets. In this paper, we provide two main contributions: (i) we present a BIM-oriented methodology for supporting building energy optimization, based on which we identify few training directions with regards to BIM, and (ii) we provide an application use case as identified in the European research project "Sporte2" to demonstrate the advantages of BIM in energy efficiency with respect to several energy metrics. {\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors.},

The study was carried out to investigate the possibilities of integrating PV systems into apartment buildings. This is a novel approach in housing within the context of North Cyprus. With the use of building information modelling (BIM) software, the possibility of this approach was tested. The study considered several cost variables and the advantages of building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems integrated into apartment buildings at the design stage of the buildings. The willingness to pay (WTP) for this technology was also tested using qualitative methods and an economic analysis was carried out to ascertain the viability and feasibility of this technology. This was in line with present government policies using the net metering system. The method of analysis was carried out using a model proposed for BIPV integration in apartment buildings.

In contrast to boundary element method (BEM), BIM is simpler and more straightforward. Therefore, BIM can not only provide an accurate prediction of the nonlinear free surface oscillation but also demonstrate the excellent efficiency of numerical calculation. Several small-scaled model tests on a shaking table, including harmonic and earthquake excitations, are carried out to verify the numerical methods. An artificial damping coefficient is introduced to simulate the energy dissipation of liquid motion.

abstract = {In the face of a rapidly changing climate and global energy crisis, this study proposes the concept of green building information modeling (Green BIM), and suggests the use of a decision-making cycle when performing building performance analysis (BPA) to obtain design proposals with optimized environmental effectiveness in response to local climate conditions when BIM is used as a basic tool from the beginning of the design process. Taking building energy performance analysis as an example, in comparison with other domestic and foreign research, the important contributions of the study include: (1) Based on a design decision-making perspective, a Green BIM-based decision-making cycle can integrate the practical steps of BIM and BPA. (2) Furthermore, this study also finds that meteorological data in a format that can be used in BPA is not easy to obtain. Nevertheless, virtual weather station technology developed using cloud technology can enable a building project to obtain simulated meteorological data relying on weather stations closest to the required criteria, and a cloud building energy analysis engine can be used to implement complex analysis involving large amount of data. As a result, the use of green-BIM technology and concepts can be promoted with greater ease. When setting energy conservation targets, this study recommends that building energy usage intensity (EUI) be employed as an integrated performance indicator for energy consumption, and percentage of performance optimization be employed as a rating criterion. Nevertheless, the use of energy conservation targets is not essential; depending on the directions in which national governments would like to lead the industry and the maturity and feasibility of relevant technologies, other feasible high-performance benchmarks proposed in this study may also be used in Green BIM. {\textcopyright} 2017 CAD Solutions, LLC.},

abstract = {Neural networks are being used to make new types of empirical chemical models as inexpensive as force fields, but with accuracy similar to the ab initio methods used to build them. In this work, we present a neural network that predicts the energies of molecules as a sum of intrinsic bond energies. The network learns the total energies of the popular GDB9 database to a competitive MAE of 0.94 kcal/mol on molecules outside of its training set, is naturally linearly scaling, and applicable to molecules consisting of thousands of bonds. More importantly, it gives chemical insight into the relative strengths of bonds as a function of their molecular environment, despite only being trained on total energy information. We show that the network makes predictions of relative bond strengths in good agreement with measured trends and human predictions. A Bonds-in-Molecules Neural Network (BIM-NN) learns heuristic relative bond strengths like expert synthetic chemists, and compares well with ab initio bond order measures such as NBO analysis. {\textcopyright} 2017 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {This paper evaluates the potential for use of building information modelling (BIM) as a tool to support the visualisation and management of a building's performance; demonstrating a method for the capture, collation and linking of data stored across the currently disparate BIM and building management system (BMS) data environments. Its intention is to identify the barriers facing implementation of BIM for building designers and operators as a performance optimisation tool. The method developed links design documentation and metered building performance to identify the technological requirements for BIM and building performance connection in a real-world example. This is supplemented by interviews with designers and operators identifying associated behavioural and methodological challenges. The practicality of implementing BIM as a performance management tool using conventional technologies is established, and recognises the need for more effective data management in both design and operation to support interlinking of these data-rich environments. Requirements for linking these environments are proposed in conjunction with feedback from building designers and operators, providing guidance for the production and sourcing of data to support building performance management using BIM. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s)},

It is foreseen that when tapped and adopted in unison, these paradigms may yield additional benefits for the construction projects. This synergy is investigated in this research. Further this study identifies and proposes Building Information Modelling (BIM) as an enabler for gaining lean and green project outcomes. The study uses crisp set qualitative comparative analysis (csQCA) method for exploring the causal combinations of different BIM capabilities and asserts that causal combinations of four BIM capabilities: MEP system modelling, energy and environment analysis, constructability analysis and structural analysis, when implemented on construction projects can lead to lean and green outcomes. With the help of sixteen cases it is shown that adoption of BIM leads to improved project outcomes especially ones targeting lean and green aspects. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Gulf Organisation for Research and Development},

abstract = {Many studies have documented that retro-commissioning provides energy savings ranging between 10 and 30{\%}; in some cases, more than 50{\%} of a building's energy consumption. Over the past two decades, retro-commissioning has evolved from being mostly a manual process to using functional testing to a semi-automated process of using monitored data to identify operational problems. Many of the issues that the retro-commissioning process identifies relate to the inability to manage and maintain building systems and controls associated with those systems. Even though retro-commissioning has proven to be cost-effective, only a small fraction of the buildings are commissioned and many buildings that are commissioned only implement a fraction of recommend retro-commissioning actions. Two primary reasons for lack of interest in retro-commissioning is a perception that: (1) retro-commissioning is expensive and (2) many retro-commissioning measures lack persistence. Many cities in the United States are mandating that some of the commercial building stock be commissioned periodically. Automation and leveraging emerging building information modeling standards can alleviate many of the concerns of retro-commissioning by providing a mechanism for automated continuous condition-based maintenance. This article describes one such reference process that can be deployed to provide continuous automated condition-based maintenance management for buildings that have building information modeling, building automation systems, and computerized maintenance management software systems. The process can be deployed using an open-source transactional network platform, VOLTTRON™, designed for distributed sensing and controls and supports both energy efficiency and grid services. {\textcopyright} 2017, Copyright {\textcopyright} Battelle Memorial Institute.},

abstract = {Environmental pollution is considered to be one of the main concerns in the construction industry. Environmental pollution has become a major challenge to construction projects due to the huge amount of pollution caused by construction projects. There are different types of environmental impact indicators, such as the greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint, eutrophication potential (EP), acidification potential (AP), human health (HH) particulate, ozone depletion, and smog. Each of these environmental impact indicators can be linked to different phases of the construction projects. The overall environmental impact indicators can be divided into direct, indirect, and operational emissions. This paper presents a Building Information Modeling (BIM)-based methodology for the assessment of environmental impacts in road construction projects. The model takes into account the overall life cycle of the road construction project, which is divided into: manufacturing phase, transportation phase, construction phase, maintenance phase, operational phase, recycling phase, and deconstruction phase. A case study is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model. The proposed model solves a major problem for road construction project teams who want to assess the environmental impact indicators associated with their project prior to the start of the execution of their projects. {\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors.},

However, the application of BIM to site location and transportation analysis is usually considered impractical due to the lack of a powerful map application in present BIM products. The aim of this research is to develop a framework for the integration of BIM and Web Map Service (WMS) technologies for location and transportation analysis in green building certifications. Using Autodesk Revit API and Google Maps API as the development tools, this research converts the integration model into the BIM-integrated plugin in Autodesk Revit.

abstract = {The South Korean Government has established a target to reduce CO2 emissions to 50 per cent by 2050. The energy consumption in the architecture, engineering and construction industry occupies about 23 per cent in the national energy consumption and the ratio of energy consumption in the AEC industry would be increased up to 40 per cent when we consider the production of construction materials and transportation of them. In this situation, it is required for the AEC industry to take part in the national CO2 reduction scheme to meet the goal. However, it is common in the AEC industry to conduct performance analysis and to assess CO2 emissions after the architectural design and construction documentation have been finished. This research is to fill the gap to assess the whole amount of carbon dioxide emissions in an early design phase. The goal of this research is to develop an integrated Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) model using Building Information Modelling (BIM) tools for evaluating energy consumption and CO2 emissions. In this research, it is expected that prompt and accurate assessment of Life Cycle Carbon Dioxide emissions (LCCO2) since we integrated the new Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) database with BIM.

abstract = {Occupants' behaviours are a major determinant of energy use in buildings. The related savings potential has been insufficiently exploited. Although research has addressed behavioural savings through real-world interventions and quantitative modelling approaches, it has not yet explored the full variety of household activities. This work proposes an integrative modelling approach of energy behaviours in the residential setting as a tool to estimate the behavioural impact of households on energy consumption. It uses building energy performance simulation (BEPS) tools to exploit the behavioural savings potential associated with usage and investment energy behaviours when using different energy services in daily household activities. Simulations have estimated significant behavioural savings potential associated with energy behaviours, which may be materialized if some forms of behaviour are induced. Investment behaviours have higher savings potential than usage behaviours, and the behavioural savings potential per energy service is proportional to the energy consumption breakdown. BEPS tools enable a quantitative estimate of the behavioural impact on energy consumption, but further improvements to these tools are needed to incorporate the complexity of behavioural dimensions. Estimating the behavioural savings potential is important for a more effective design of behaviour change interventions, which in turn will support more effective energy efficiency policies. {\textcopyright} 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\&} Francis Group.},

They have explored various technologies, such as video cameras, radio signal strength indicator-based sensors, and motion sensors, in the development of tracking systems. However, each system presents unique drawbacks especially when applied in complex indoor construction environments; this paper classifies them into two categories: absolute tracking and relative tracking. By understanding the nature of problems in each tracking category, this research develops a novel tracking methodology that uses knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of various components used in the proposed tracking system. This paper presents the development of a hybrid-tracking system that integrates Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology, motion sensors, and Building Information Model (BIM). The hypothesis tested through this integration was whether such knowledge-based integration could provide a method that can correct errors found in each of the used sensing technologies and thereby improve the reliability of the tracking system. Field experimental trials were conducted in a full-scale indoor construction site to assess the performance of individual components and the integrated system. The results indicated that the addition of map knowledge from a BIM model showed the capability of correcting improbable movements. Furthermore, the knowledge-based decision making process demonstrated its capability to make positive interaction by reducing the positioning errors by 42{\%} on average. In sum, the proposed hybrid-tracking system presented a novel method to compensate for the weakness of each system component and thus achieve a more accurate and precise tracking in dynamic and complex indoor construction sites. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

This objective was attained by a critical and extensive literature review that covers the following: (1) building energy consumption, (2) building energy performance and analysis, and (3) BIM and energy assessment. Literature cited in this paper shows that linking an energy analysis tool with a BIM model has helped project design teams to predict and create optimized energy consumption by conducting building energy performance analysis utilizing key performance indicators on average thermal transmitters, resulting heat demand, lighting power, solar heat gains, and ventilation heat losses. An in-depth analysis was conducted on a completed BIM integrated construction project utilizing the Arboleda Project in the Dominican Republic to validate the aforementioned findings. Results show that the BIM-based energy analysis helped the design team attain the world׳s first positive energy building. This study concludes that linking an energy analysis tool with a BIM model helps to expedite the energy analysis process, provide more detailed and accurate results, and deliver energy-efficient buildings. This study further recommends that the adoption of level 2 BIM and BIM integration in energy optimization analysis must be demanded by building regulatory agencies for all projects regardless of procurement method (i.e., government funded or otherwise) or size. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors},

abstract = {There is a growing interest in integrating life cycle assessment (LCA) into building design decision making due to LCA's comprehensive and systemic approach to environmental evaluation. Many green building rating systems (GBRSs) use LCA to various degrees. In this paper, a comparative study was performed to evaluate the LCA software tools available to building designers. A whole-building LCA was performed for a large building using three software LCA tools. The software tools vary in key aspects, such as intended users (e.g., LCA experts or novices), design stage in which they can be used, and time. The evaluated LCA tools varied significantly in the possibility of their use in early design and decision making. Some of the applications rely on a bill of materials that changes constantly in design alterations. However, others showed a greater advantage in that they can be integrated from the beginning of the design process. The comparative LCA results indicated that the impact of LCA software is dependent on the impact category and the precision in the process of material quantities takeoff. The case study was influenced by the building type and its intense operational energy requirements. Conventional energy efficiency measures, such as increasing the lighting efficiency, far exceeded what can be done to mitigate the embedded impact of construction materials. Thus, advancing the requirements of the LCA baseline building and addressing the operational phase in a more comprehensive framework are discussed. Finally, this paper examines the traditional building's systems that are usually involved in LCA and the possibility of adding other systems, such as plumbing, HVAC, and electrical systems, using building information modeling (BIM). {\textcopyright} 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Intelligent management systems (IMSs) have significant potential for energy savings, but they have not been fully used in buildings and cities. Smart sensor systems based on user behavior will improve indoor environmental quality (IEQ) and user comfort. A cost-effective strategy has been implemented by using a low-technology and high-performance approach.

abstract = {The exchange and provision of interdisciplinary information is a key to leverage of sophisticated cross-domain BIM applications like project controlling, simulations, energy efficiency or building automation. Thereby existing data formats, domain applications and information processes must be retained as far as possible. As current interoperability methods cannot cope with this challenge satisfactorily, the multimodel method is presented here, which enables interdisciplinary construction information processes on the base of original data. A multimodel therefore combines heterogeneous models of different domains. The loose cross-model coupling of data elements is neutrally stored in external ID-based link models. As the single domain models remain unaffected, they can still be used by traditional applications. Because of the absence of a leading or integrating data scheme, no transformation processes are required, common established data formats can be reused and the linked domain models can be exchanged neutrally. The linked data in multimodels offers an additional value of information in contrast to the single domain models. Information belonging together can be automatically evaluated by the persistent links. Thus, a multimodel appears to a user as a single self-contained information space. While the method focuses on closed world data exchange scenarios, it is not intended to form a singular project information space. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Monitoring and modelling studies of the indoor environment indicate that there are often discrepancies between simulation results and measurements. The availability of large monitoring datasets of domestic buildings allows for more rigorous validation of the performance of building simulation models derived from limited building information, backed by statistical significance tests and goodness-of-fit metrics. These datasets also offer the opportunity to test modelling assumptions. This paper investigates the performance of domestic housing models using EnergyPlus software to predict maximum daily indoor temperatures over the summer of 2011. Monitored maximum daily indoor temperatures from the English Housing Survey's (EHS) Energy Follow-Up Survey (EFUS) for 823 nationally representative dwellings are compared against predictions made by EnergyPlus simulations. Due to lack of information on the characteristics of individual dwellings, the models struggle to predict maximum temperatures in individual dwellings and performance was worse on days when the outdoor maximum temperatures were high. This research indicates that unknown factors such as building characteristics, occupant behaviour and local environment makes the validation of models for individual dwellings a challenging task. The models did, however, provide an improved estimate of temperature exposure when aggregated over dwellings within a particular region. {\textcopyright} 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\&} Francis Group.},

abstract = {Current environmental problems arising from the building sector require tools to help reduce resource consumption and environmental impact. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a widely used tool to quantify the environmental impacts of the building sector. The literature recognizes the need to simplify the method application, especially to reduce and optimize data acquisition. Building Information Modeling (BIM) is defined as a virtual 3D building model which integrates with a database of their building elements. Several studies recognize that the integration of BIM and LCA can simplify data acquisition of the building as well as provide both tools with feedback. This paper reviews recent studies centered on BIM-based LCA, and also carries out a methodological analysis of their integration, focusing on the way that BIM can contribute to simplifying data input, and optimize output data and results during the LCA application in buildings. The results show the viability to develop methods based on BIM models for organizing building information used to estimate environmental and energy consumption impacts based on LCA, including: templates and plug-ins for BIM software, and the integration of automated processes combining different data and software. Reviewed papers are simplified LCA applications, mostly focused on CO2 emission calculation during the early stages of design.

Current facility management (FM) information systems are complex and provide high-quality data. However, they lack interoperability and visualization capabilities. The goal of this study is to improve the quality of data collected that is required for corrective maintenance by utilizing visualization and interoperability capabilities of building information modeling (BIM). To achieve that, an approach that implements industry foundation classes (IFC) BIM to link and present alarms reported by FM systems, such as building energy management systems (BEMS) and building automation systems (BAS), with related data from computerized maintenance management systems (CMMS) was developed and validated on a typical university building. The results showed an efficiency increase in high-quality maintenance data collection. The proposed approach supplements the existing body of knowledge in the FM domain by providing a schema that integrates corrective maintenance data in a three-dimensional (3D) IFC-BIM environment. Moreover, it provides a process to minimize the corrective maintenance lead-time and link equipment failures to the related maintenance information. FM practitioners can use this approach to decrease the lead-time needed corrective maintenance responses and focus their resources on productive maintenance tasks. {\textcopyright} 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract = {Construction sites need to be monitored continuously to detect unsafe conditions and protect workers from potential injuries and fatal accidents. In current practices, construction-safety monitoring relies heavily on manual observation, which is labor-intensive and error-prone. Due to the complex environment of construction sites, it is extremely challenging for safety inspectors to continuously monitor and manually identify all incidents that may expose workers to safety risks. There exist many research efforts applying sensing technologies to construction sites to reduce the manual efforts associated with construction-safety monitoring. However, several bottlenecks are identified in applying these technologies to the onsite safety monitoring process, including (1) recognition and registration of potential hazards, (2) real-time detection of unsafe incidents, and (3) reporting and sharing of the detected incidents with relevant participants in a timely manner. The objective of this study was to create and evaluate a low-cost automated safety monitoring system to assist in the construction-safety monitoring process. This paper presents a framework for this safety monitoring system as a cloud-based real time on-site application. The system integrates Bluetooth low-energy (BLE)-based location detection technology, building information model (BIM)-based hazard identification, and a cloud-based communication platform. Potential unsafe areas are defined automatically or manually in a BIM model. Real-time worker locations are acquired to detect incidents where workers are exposed to predefined risks. Then, the safety monitoring results are instantly communicated over the cloud for effective safety management. Through a real-world construction site case study, the system successfully demonstrated the capability to detect unsafe conditions and collect and analyze the trajectories of workers with respect to potential safety hazards. The results indicate that the proposed approach can assist in the construction site monitoring process and potentially improve site safety. {\textcopyright} 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract = {The European Energy Efficiency Directive requests the application of high quality and cost effective energy audits across Europe. The potential of up to 20{\%} of energy savings shall be realized to follow the strategy of smart, sustainable, and inclusive growth. A number of barriers must be tackled to implement the Directive, especially among small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). A large number of cost effective energy efficiency measures remains unimplemented because of financial reasons, a lack of information, and limited in-house skills. Information measures, audits, capacity buildings are suggested as potentially effective measures to support implementation of energy efficiency measures. Within the work described in this paper, an auditing approach was developed, focusing on modelling the energy consumption of an SME. The model of the energy consumption is built using simple MS Excel tools, dividing the process into unit operations and attributing annual consumption to these units, from measurements or by calculation. Consumption is linked to drivers of consumption and corresponding losses, thus developing an understanding of the origin of energy consumption, priorities, and the potential for reduction. The approach simultaneously addresses the needs for the identification of measures, capacity building, information and awareness raising. The auditing approach was tested with 280 companies in Austria, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Italy, Romania, Slovakia and Spain. A wide range of energy efficiency measures was identified and implemented, partly consisting of no-cost options, but partly also innovative technical solutions. Over EUR 10 million investments with a simple payback time of less than three years were triggered. 6500 toe per year of primary energy savings were realized, as well as greenhouse gas emission reductions of 13,500 tonnes per year. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

Considering the fact that Egypt is the highest water consumer and sewage producer in the region makes it even more challenging to work on this quest. The main problem which faces the sanitation municipalities in Egypt is that most of the sanitation infrastructure is aging because it was built in the first half of the previous century. This research aims at presenting a framework for planning sustainable sanitation collection and treatment systems through the utilization of Building Information Modeling (BIM), Building Performance Modeling (BPM) and Computer Simulation (CS). Firstly, the procedure of using BIM and the difference between BIM workflow and drafting-centric workflow are demonstrated to ensure clear understanding of the new system, Building Performance Modeling is utilized to model an anaerobic sewage treatment plant, and then the outputs of the model are presented. Information models of a part of a sewer network and an anaerobic treatment plant are introduced to show how Building Information Modeling can improve the sustainability of the system. Also, a simulation tool is presented to model the flow in the sewer network to help in monitoring the pipeline's performance, and condition. In addition, it aids in detecting any failures in the system and in guiding the operator to the most suitable rehabilitation or replacement technique to deal with the detected failure. Finally, a solar study is introduced to replace the auxiliary electrical loads of the buildings in the wastewater treatment plant with solar energy to enforce the environmental and economical dimensions of sustainability. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

BIM offers sophisticated tools for electrical trade design and estimation. This paper primarily investigates with supportive case studies, the potential applications of BIM in electrical system design and analysis. Further, its energy analysis, geographical scale significance and smart built environmental applications are also investigated. This research emphasizes on the deployment of BIM at both static and dynamic level for electrical trade such that BIM electrical system design can be made more attractive and more cost effective. The preliminary investigations indicate that seamless integration of semantic information system of BIM with Geographical Information System (GIS) can be very useful for electrical grid optimization and city energy modelling. {\textcopyright} 2017 Eastern Macedonia and Thrace Institute of Technology.},

The authors present an innovative solution for combining building information modeling (BIM) data with ambient information collected by heterogeneous devices deployed in the building. To collect environmental information, they exploit a distributed software architecture. It enables interoperability between heterogeneous data sources - either physical devices, such as sensor nodes, or third-party software such as Archibus - where building information resides. On top of this infrastructure, they developed an Android-based application that presents environmental building information integrated with BIM data in an augmented and virtual reality environment.

Furthermore, the need for enhancing and increasing productivity in the building industry turns new technologies and building energy performance simulation environments into extremely interesting solutions towards rigorous analysis and decision making in renovation within acceptable risk levels. The present work describes a multidisciplinary approach for the estimation of the energy performance of an educational building. The research involved data acquisition with advanced geomatic tools, the development of an optimized building information model, and energy assessment in Building Performance Simulation (BPS) software. Interoperability issues were observed in the different steps of the process. The inspection and diagnostic phases were conducted in a timely, accurate manner thanks to automated data acquisition and subsequent analysis using Building Information Modeling based tools (BIM-based tools). Energy simulation was performed using Design Builder, and the results obtained were compared with those yielded by the official software tool established by Spanish regulations for energy certification. The discrepancies between the results of both programs have proven that the official software program is conservative in this sense. This may cause the depreciation of the assessed buildings. {\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI.},

abstract = {Purpose - Green Star is becoming a broadly accepted mark of design quality and environmental sustainability. Compared to other green tools, Green Star is considered as one of main streams green assessment tools, which cover almost sustainable criteria. Simultaneously, building information modelling (BIM) has also been introduced into the industry. BIM is expected to aid designers to shift the construction industry towards more environmentally and economically sustainable construction practice. Whilst the aspirations of Green Star rating and BIM implementation are broadly aligned, in the context of New Zealand this has led to some disconnects in design strategy and process. The purpose of this paper is to improve the practicality of BIM implementations for delivering Green Star certification in New Zealand. Design/methodology/approach - The extensive literature review is conducted through a series of incremental steps. A conceptual framework focussing on the relationship between benefits and challenges of BIM and Green Star is then developed. Findings - BIM supports practitioners to achieve the majority of Green Star criteria (75 per cent). Energy efficiency criterion is the key factor affecting the assessment process of Green Star and National Australian Built Environment Rating System in New Zealand. Research questions about lessening the challenges which can be encountered during the BIM and Green Star implementation are developed. Research limitations/implications - This paper is limited to a conceptual research. Further empirical research should be conducted to validate and modify the conceptual framework and the propositions presented in this paper to provide an initial insight into BIM and Green Star connectivity within the context of New Zealand. Originality/value - This paper provided a clear picture for investors, developers, practitioners about benefits and challenges of BIM and Green Star implementation. The outcomes are anticipated to deliver visions for shifting the country further towards development of sustainable future cities. {\textcopyright} Emerald Publishing Limited.},

To meet the sustainability requirements of a building, changes or decisions must be made to a building during the design and preconstruction stages. This can be possible using Building Information Modelling (BIM). To demonstrate the use of BIM in sustainable design, a villa is taken for model study. The conventional building performance is analysed using Autodesk Revit which included various parameters like energy use intensity, lifecycle energy use/cost, annual carbon emissions, monthly heating and cooling loads, monthly peak demand and monthly electricity and fuel consumption. By employing the use of green materials in the conventional building model, the conventional building model is modified into a green building model. Using BIM, the use of artificial resources can be greatly reduced by replacing them with the use of renewable energy resources thereby saving energy. To show how efficient BIM is, the results of the performance of the conventional and green building models are compared. BIM has proved to be efficient in achieving sustainability with earlier decision making and rectification of errors.},

abstract = {The UK Government has set out ambitious plans for all new domestic and commercial buildings to be zero carbon rated by 2016 and 2020 respectively. These are some of the most progressive environmental targets for the built environment in the western world. However, there are also other sustainability issues that need to be addressed by the UK construction industry, particularly negative impacts from the generation of waste. Currently, 100 million tonnes of construction waste, including 13 million tonnes of unused materials, is generated each year, with only 20{\%} currently capable of being recycled. The majority of this waste ends up in landfill, contributing to further pollution of the biosphere. The literature suggests that these negative impacts result from a variety of causes, including ineffective leadership, ingrained cultures, outdated technologies and poor logistics. There are a number of innovative projects within the UK, particularly at a local level, that pose the question as to whether bottom up approaches may be more successful than top down policies, as set by national and local government. This paper presents a case study demonstrating the former approach within the construction industry. Research and consultancy has been undertaken collaboratively between industry, academia and professional practice in the production of 15 individually designed sustainable dwellings in the North East of England. This project has employed Building Information Modelling (BIM) as a new collaborative working platform, aligned to the Modern Method of Construction (MMC). By situating this inquiry within an authentic case study it has highlighted ineffective strategies, policies and leadership, which have prevented full exploitation of the potential of BIM and MMC towards sustainable production. This inquiry supports the integration of the Framework for Sustainable Strategic Development (FSSD) into construction procurement, as a method for implementing bottom up leadership in a value driven project. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

These technologies are typically considered as complementary to existing and often used Building Information Modelling (BIM) software. The usage of these technologies in the AEC domains is thereby motivated by (1) a desire to overcome the interoperability issue among software tools used in diverse disciplines, or at least improve information exchange processes; (2) a desire to connect to various domains of application that have opportunities to identify untapped valuable resources closely linked to the information already obtained in the AEC domains; and/or (3) a desire to exploit the logical basis of these technologies, which is currently undisclosed in the AEC domains. Through an extensive literature study and survey, this article investigates the development and application progress of semantic web technologies in the AEC domains in accordance with these three primary perspectives. These examinations and analyses provide a complete strategical map that can serve as a robust stepping stone for future research regarding the application of semantic web technologies in the AEC domains. Results show that semantic web technologies have a key role to play in logic-based applications and applications that require information from multiple application areas (e.g. BIM + Infra + GIS + Energy). Notwithstanding fast developments and hard work, challenging research opportunities are situated in (1) the creation and maintenance of the links between the various data sets and in (2) devising beneficial implementation approaches that rely on appropriate combinations of declarative and procedural programming techniques, semantic and legacy data formats, user input, and automated procedures. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Industrial buildings demand higher amount of energy than other building typologies, thus powerful modelling and simulation tools for energy-optimisation and identification of synergies-potentials between the building envelope, building services and production systems are needed. Building Information Modelling (BIM), as emerging technology, bears promise to support processes integration thus enabling life-cycle management of buildings. BIM model serves as a joint knowledge database where data transfer between various models is possible; thereby enabling follow up studies, such as cost, thermal and structural analysis. Adoption of BIM to BEM (building energy modelling) approach is particularly interesting for optimisation of industrial facilities. Multiple layers of interacting complex systems (building, services and machine floor layout) require careful modelling and control of geometry in terms of collisions, various adaptions due to the short product-life-cycles, as well as integrated energy performance analysis along interacting systems. This paper explores the potentials and deficits of the modelling, analysis and optimisation of energy-efficient industrial buildings using BIM to BEM methodology, by means of case study research of two industrial facilities. Varying needs concerning the Level of Development and semantic differences in the modelling procedures of part-taking disciplines (architecture, structural engineering or analysis) were identified as problems; as well as time pressure as one of the main reasons for defects of building models. The identified deficits represent various types of uncertainties related to the integrated energy modelling, as BIM to BEM can be referred to. We conclude that as a first step of integrated modelling, an uncertainty-analysis should be carried out, and strategies how to deal with these developed. In order to minimise BIM to BEM uncertainties, not only interoperability issues of the software has to be improved (modelling uncertainty), but moreover, the redefinition of the design process and enhancement of individual capabilities is necessary (process uncertainty). {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {The construction industry has been evolving to embrace sustainability, this has highlighted the necessity to inspect sustainable performances throughout the post-construction building lifecycle. The application of relevant building management systems (BMS) to achieve this goal is essential. Likewise, it is vital to balance the maximization of building energy efficiency and users' desired level of comfort while employing an efficient BMS for sustainable maintenance of facility operations. The high probability of inaccurate manual building inspections plus the lack of real-time input of dynamic factors urges development of automated BMS. Therefore, Building Information Modelling (BIM) plays a key role towards automation in construction and corresponding management systems. Despite the nD capability of BIM enabling its potential practice during building lifecycle phases, designers-contractors focused primarily on the application of BIM during design-construction management stages. Moreover, integration of knowledge management systems empower handling and sharing of building maintenance information during the building lifecycle, this is suggested as essential for post-construction sustainable performance. Focusing on building energy efficiency, this article has reviewed 96 papers and suggests engagement of an Integrated Knowledge-based Building Management System using nD BIM applications (BIM-IKBMS) during the post-construction building lifecycle to advance the successful implementation of sustainable building performances. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

The requirement for 3D building models for computer-based energy simulation minimized the use of this technology in everyday practice. With the appearance of BIM applications that enable creation of information rich 3D building models, everyone expected that this technology can easily provide all data necessary for energy consumption simulation. Today, the market is full of different BIM related applications that are advertised as solutions for the green building design. The paper gives an overview of energy consumption simulation tools and their connection to two BIM applications - ArchiCAD and Revit and demonstrates that recent development of both technologies does not fully meet expectations. The paper indicates means to avoid overoptimistic expectations from software tools that can help designers to achieve better comprehension of the real merits that BIM can bring to green building design. The paper addresses usability of using BIM for sustainable refurbishment. The paper concludes with the analysis of the Semantic Web technologies which can contribute to a better understanding of simulation results, and can provide more information about energy efficiency of the components used in BIM applications' libraries. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Author.},

First of all, all the typologies of buildings have been studied to choose which one is the ideal model. A multidisciplinary approach has been applied to deal with this task, including the design of an indoor unit mounted on a trolley and a UAV drone unit for the complete, geometric and thermographic, measurement of the building's envelope. All processed data have been compiled in Building Information Models (BIM) containing also all the information required for the energy evaluation of the building. These models were made with all the data georeferenced so they could be automatically incorporated into the energy analysis software. Several of this energy analysis software were used to evaluate the model and the results have been compared, focusing on the complexity and the percentage deviation of results. A methodology for evaluating the energy generated by buildings has been developed, and it also includes the creation and evaluation of innovative building solutions that would lead us to reduce energy consumption. These solutions have been gathered in a manual for use in several similar buildings. {\textcopyright} International Journal of Sustainable Building Technology and Urban Development.},

This paper presents several aspects of a building monitoring and control system that has been developed. The system is based on a multi-sensorial network which is able to capture sustainability-related metrics due to the use of heterogeneous sensors such as occupancy detection sensors, environmental sensors, power consumption sensors and actuators. The availability of occupancy information at room or zone level which is achieved via the occupancy sensors, offers the opportunity to extract valuable information about the way the building is utilized. Furthermore, as the occupancy patterns considerably affect the building's indoor environmental condition and the consumed energy, occupancy estimation turns into a useful tool for the facility manager to analyze and then improve the building's energy performance and enhance the indoor environmental quality by applying control actions through the actuators. The building information is visualized in the spatio-Temporal domain to both the facility manager and the occupants via two different components. The system has been evaluated in real-life conditions at a building which is comprised of different types of spaces. Results showed that useful conclusions are drawn when occupancy information is combined with the other monitored parameters. {\textcopyright} 2017 WIT Press.},

abstract = {Energy efficiency in buildings is one of the main goals of many governmental policies due to their high impact on the carbon dioxide emissions in Europe. One of these targets is to reduce the energy consumption in healthcare buildings, which are known to be among the most energy-demanding building types. Although design decisions made at early design phases have a significant impact on the energy performance of the realized buildings, only a small portion of possible early designs is analyzed, which does not ensure an optimal building design. We propose an automated early design support workflow, accompanied by a set of tools, for achieving nearly zero emission healthcare buildings. It is intended to be used by decision makers during the early design phase. It starts with the user-defined brief and the design rules, which are the input for the Early Design Configurator (EDC). The EDC generates multiple design alternatives following an evolutionary algorithm while trying to satisfy user requirements and geometric constraints. The generated alternatives are then validated by means of an Early Design Validator (EDV), and then, early energy and cost assessments are made using two early assessment tools. A user-friendly dashboard is used to guide the user and to illustrate the workflow results, whereas the chosen alternative at the end of the workflow is considered as the starting point for the next design phases. Our proposal has been implemented using Building Information Models (BIM) and validated by means of a case study on a healthcare building and several real demonstrations from different countries in the context of the European project STREAMER. {\textcopyright} 2017 by the author.},

abstract = {Food industry is the production sector with the highest energy consumption. In Europe, the energy used to produce food accounts for 26{\%} of total energy consumption. Over 28{\%} is used in industrial processes. Recently, European food companies have increased their efforts to make their production processes more sustainable, also by giving preference to the use of renewable energy sources. In Italy, the total energy consumption in agriculture and food sectors decreased between 2013 and 2014, passing from 16.79 to 13.3 Mtep. Since energy consumption in food industry is nearly twice the one in agriculture (8.57 and 4.73 Mtep, respectively), it is very important to improve energy efficiency and use green technologies in all the phases of food processing and conservation. In Italy, a recent law (Legislative Decree 102, 04/07/2014) has made energy-use diagnosis compulsory for all industrial concerns, particularly for those showing high consumption levels. In the case of food industry buildings, energy is mainly used for indoor microclimate control, which is needed to ensure workers' wellbeing and the most favourable conditions for food processing and conservation. To this end, it is important to have tools and methods allowing for easy, rapid and precise energy performance assessment of agri-food buildings. The accuracy of the results obtainable from the currently available computational models depends on the grade of detail and information used in constructional and geometric modelling. Moreover, this phase is probably the most critical and time-consuming in the energy diagnosis. In this context, fine surveying and advanced 3D geometric modelling procedures can facilitate building modelling and allow technicians and professionals in the agri-food sector to use highly efficient and accurate energy analysis and evaluation models. This paper proposes a dedicated model for energy performance assessment in agri-food buildings. It also shows that by using advanced surveying techniques, such as a terrestrial laser scanner and an infrared camera, it is possible to create a three-dimensional parametric model, while, thanks to the heat flow meter measurement method, it is also possible to obtain a thermophysical model. This model allows assessing the energy performance of agri-food buildings in order to improve the indoor microclimate control and the conditions of food processing and conservation. {\textcopyright} F.

The measured melting enthalpy 328 kJ/kg, 408 kJ/kg, and 660 kJ/kg is much higher in all cases than the usual found in commercial PCM (100 kJ/kg), therefore, these ILs synthetized in this study are proper candidates to be used as PCM because of the huge amounts of energy that they are able to store and their low cost. Moreover, biobPCM are sustainable materials since its obtaining process is based on oil. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Samples were synthesized by two methods, that is, the solid-state sintering at various temperatures and mechanical activation in a high-energy ball mill. The compounds were obtained from a mixture of three polycrystalline powder oxides, that is, TiO2, Fe2O3 and Bi2O3. At room temperature, the Aurivillius compounds are paramagnetic materials with orthorhombic crystal structure. The c lattice parameter of the unit cell depends linearly on the m - number of layers with perovskite- -like structure. Based on the M{\"{o}}ssbauer studies, it is concluded that the hyperfine interactions parameters do not change with m number. {\textcopyright} 2017 Mariusz Mazurek et al.},

abstract = {Despite the consensus that waste efficient design is important for reducing waste generated by construction and demolition activities, design strategies for actual waste mitigation remain unclear. In addition, decisive roles required of designers in designing out waste remains inadequately addressed. As such, this study aims to map out attributes of waste effective design and design documents. Drawing on series of semi-structured focus group discussions with experts from the UK leading design and construction companies, this paper employs qualitative approach to explore design and design document qualities for waste efficient construction projects. The study suggests that for a design to assist in reducing construction and demolition waste, it needs to fulfil five key requisites, while its documentation is expected to fulfil four key requisites. A waste efficient design would incorporate standardization and dimensional coordination, employ principles in modern methods of construction, provides measures for spatial and components flexibility, make provisions for end of life deconstruction and employs techniques in BIM for design coordination. Waste efficient design documentation, on the other hand, is characterised by completeness and clarity, certainty and timeliness, freedom from error, and incorporation of set of plans and schedules that are waste militating. A validation of these findings in a case study of waste-to-energy project confirmed that the strategies are essential to preventing construction waste. Measures through which design and design documents could achieve the identified waste effective attributes are highlighted and discussed. Findings of this study could assist in understanding a set of measures that should be taken at project planning and design stages in order to mitigate waste intensiveness of the construction industry. It would as well assist designers in understanding a set of attributes that must be possessed by design and design documents in order to design out construction waste. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in neonates. Because of high concentrations of sensitive immature cells, metal-catalyzed free radicals, non-saturated fatty acids, and low concentrations of antioxidant enzymes, the brain requires high levels of oxygen supply and is, thus, extremely sensitive to hypoxia. Strong evidence indicates that oxidative stress plays an important role in pathogenesis and progression. Following hypoxia and ischemia, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production rapidly increases and overwhelms antioxidant defenses. A large excess of ROS will directly modify or degenerate cellular macromolecules, such as membranes, proteins, lipids, and DNA, and lead to a cascading inflammatory response, and protease secretion. These derivatives are involved in a complex interplay of multiple pathways (e.g., inflammation, apoptosis, autophagy, and necrosis) which finally lead to brain injury. In this review, we highlight the molecular mechanism for oxidative stress in HIE, summarize current research on therapeutic strategies utilized in combating oxidative stress, and try to explore novel potential clinical approaches. {\textcopyright} 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract = {Background: Nowadays wind energy is becoming increasingly significant in the planning, development and growth of new electricity supply systems. Special attention has been given to land-based turbines for ensuring the efficient economical operation of massive hubs rising 100m above the ground, based on the idea that the bigger the turbine, the more complicated are the transportation and assembly processes. Methods: A new design of a wind turbine has several advantages compared to conventional designs; one of these advantages lies in the use of prefabricated elements, which increases efficiency. The implementation of information technology as a complement to prefabrication techniques is a further aim of this research, which seeks to improve the overall performance of the project. Consequently, Building Information Modelling is suggested as the most suitable methodology for complementing off-site techniques and reaching higher efficiency by improving design, manufacture, transportation and assembly processes. Results: This paper will present the research project “hybrid² tower for wind turbines” funded by the State of Hesse, Germany, which focuses on a new, efficient and economical design for high wind turbine towers. The new hybrid² tower is composed of a concrete tower containing prefabricated concrete quarter-circle elements, steel beams and a steel tube tower on the top. The combination of concrete and steel beams improves the static and dynamic performance of the main supporting structure. With this new design, the weight of the concrete tower is estimated to decrease by 40 {\%} compared to a traditional full-concrete tower and, as a positive consequence, the cost of assembly (including assembly on site) is reduced. Conclusions: Due to the energy revolution, a special focus is put on the development of renewable energies, especially wind power. The steadily increasing hub heights of wind turbines means that tower structures have to be more massive. The development of the hybrid² tower by using Building Information Modeling and prefabrication techniques leads to an optimized performance and reduces transport and assembly costs. {\textcopyright} 2016, Alvarez-Anton et al.},

abstract = {Energy performance assessments (EPAs) are widely conducted on buildings, which consume considerable energy and emit a significant amount of greenhouse gases. However, manual-based traditional EPA methods can cause serious problems, such as recurrent and error-prone data replication, data leaks, and redundant data processing and storage. Building information modeling (BIM), as an integrated repository of information about a particular building, has been applied to EPAs to overcome those problems. Although BIM has the potential to increase work efficiency in the assessment process, low interoperability between BIM data and energy simulation models raises huge barriers to reliable BIM-based EPAs. This research aims to improve the interoperability of BIM-based EPAs by developing an environment that contains a process, a materials library, and an EPA support system that connects BIM and energy modeling. To validate the suggested environment, we conducted a case study, and the results show that the proposed environment greatly contributes to increased accuracy and efficiency in the EPA with high interoperability. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Research on digitizing the various aspects of a typical building project has been on the increase since the advent of Building Information Modelling (BIM). Most efforts build on information technology capabilities already achieved in the various professional domains associated with different stages of the building life cycle. It is predicted that BIM will help to drastically reduce errors, fast-track project delivery time and save implementation costs. As such BIM is now being utilized in the various professional domains and project stages. However, research suggests that the building operation and management stage is being left behind despite the abundance of data collected using building management systems (BMS) of varying degrees of sophistication. It is therefore important to consider exploring BIM applications that encompasses the building operation phase. This will enhance the evaluation of building performance in use and provide feedback to the design stage which could help eliminate design-related performance issues. A framework for utilizing feedback loops from building energy consumption to inform and improve design and facility management in a BIM environment is therefore proposed. A prototype illustrating the framework is implemented in. NET framework interfaced with a BIM-enabled tool and tested in the refinement of a pre-designed school using data from the operations phase of another school delivered previously. We conclude that the framework developed in this research can contribute to bridging existing gaps between the design, construction and operation phases of a building's life-cycle. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

In this work, the development of a Building Energy Analysis Model (BEAM) predicting whole building heat and moisture transfer is presented. The coupled heat and moisture transfer model takes into account most of the main hygrothermal effects in buildings. The coupled system model is implemented in Matlab, and verified with EnergyPlus. Furthermore, BEAM is reduced via a physically based model order reduction to a lower order system model (Re-BEAM) to be easily integrated with a control algorithm. By utilizing Re-BEAM, a Model-Based Predictive Control (MBPC) method is developed to incorporate critical building information into control algorithms, such that the building energy consumption is minimized while comfort conditions are maintained. The resulting optimal setpoint schedule can be applied on any HVAC system. Simulation results of a building structure demonstrate the superiority in terms of energy and peak load reductions compared with traditional constant control methods and control methods that use a occupants-varying temperature schedule. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Furfural is regarded as an important platform chemical with a wide range of applications. Because of the low concentration of furfural in the hydrolysate, energy-saving and environmentally friendly separation method is urgently demanded. In this work, a homogeneous mixed matrix membrane (MMM) consisting of Zn2(bim)4 as inorganic filler and PMPS (polymethylphenylsiloxane) as polymer matrix was successfully fabricated by employing a solution-blending method. The vapor permeation experiments demonstrated that the pervaporation separation index (PSI) increased with increasing temperature, indicating the high performance of the as-synthesized Zn2(bim)4-PMPS membrane for separating furfural at high temperature. Hereafter, the dehydration reaction of xylose into furfural in a membrane reactor coupled with Zn2(bim)4-PMPS membrane was carried out. In contrast to the conventional reactor, the furfural yield in membrane reactor kept increasing due to the in-situ recovery of furfural by vapor permeation. The highest furfural yield achieved till now was 41.1{\%} at 140 °C in aqueous solution. Owing to the intrinsic separation properties of Zn2(bim)4 crystals and the effective enhancement of membrane stability by interaction of Zn2(bim)4 with PMPS matrix, the Zn2(bim)4-PMPS membrane coupled reactor exhibited better performance than pure PMPS membrane coupled reactor. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

This optimal photocatalyst shows efficient reproducible hydrogen evolution (638 $\mu$molh−1 g−1) under visible light, which is about 7.6 times higher than BTO and 1.55 times higher than g-C3N4. The optimal loading of BTO nanorods on g-C3N4 increases light absorption to generate more photoelectrons and simultaneously promotes separation and transfer of photoinduced electrons and holes, which arises from the intrinsic electric field formed between the (Bi2O2)2+ slabs and the (Bim−1TiO3m+1) units in Bi2Ti2O7 and Bi4Ti3O12. On the basis of further obtained temperature dependent experimental results through the Arrhenius relationship, mechanism of temperature dependent spontaneous polarization is proposed. This study offers new insight into the design of efficient ternary heterostructured advanced materials for water treatment to resolve the energy crisis problem. {\textcopyright} 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

abstract = {In response to rising energy costs and the impetus to reduce environmental impacts, upgrading the large building stock that is responsible for 40{\%} of the total energy consumption to maximum energy efficiency is becoming an important task. Despite the many benefits associated with retrofit projects, they are still only slowly being implemented because of the many challenges that exist. One of these challenges is optimizing the decision between renovation scenarios based on economic and environmental goals, which can be made possible with an accurate pre-retrofit model. The intention of this paper is to introduce a pre-retrofit model that efficiently obtains and integrates multiple forms of building data as a critical step to develop a comprehensive understanding of a building to be renovated. Opportunities for utilizing building information modeling (BIM) and geographical information systems (GIS) for retrofitting projects were explored through the study of a historical campus building. With the use of as-is geometric data and as-is data, building data maps were obtained. The next step of this study is to use the model to conduct scenarios comparison and optimize renovation decision based on economic and environmental goals. {\textcopyright} 2016, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Among the wide range types of different buildings, Public buildings are considered as one of the biggest energy-consuming sector in the world and major part of this amount is used by the air conditioning system especially in tropical climates. The most effective decisions related to sustainable design of a building facility are made in the feasibility and early design stages. Building Information Modeling (BIM) can expedite this process and provide the opportunity of testing and assessing different design alternatives and materials selection that may impact on energy performance of buildings. This paper aims at evaluating the efficiency of various types of wall materials with regard to theirs properties on energy saving. The case study in this paper is modeled by means of BIM application and then simulated by software, which is appropriate for energy analysis. The current energy consumption patterns of this case identified and shifted to the optimized level of energy usages by changing the walls materials to find most optimized of walls materials.

abstract = {The single family home market is facing increasing challenges in managing environmental issues. The required objective of building energy performance can be achieved by limiting extra cost, integrating building design, and using the most appropriate and readily available materials. However, standard computations, such as the French building energy code used here, require vocational expertise that involves managing separate processes and numerous design variables. The design is therefore restricted to well-known techniques, especially for small constructions. In this paper, the usual stakeholder constraints and possible developments in design practice are considered through the use of real product databases and vocational tools to calculate construction costs. In the first stage, which takes into account cost and energy demand, an integrated approach to building envelope design is detailed, including a semantic system to automate the process. Then an optimization method (a genetic algorithm) is proposed to assess energy performance and the cost of the building envelope. This process is illustrated as a case study for a single family house. The results highlight various optimal solution domains specific to the case study, which can be further managed through a decision support system. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

The results showed that in methanol solution the weakening of ethylenic C=C bond after photoexcitation initiates a barrierless relaxation via one-bond rotation around it, until the reactive molecule reaches a low-energy intermediate with strong charge-transfer character, then a S1/S0 conical intersection optimized near the charge-transfer intermediate is responsible for the fluorescence quenching in the dilute solution. The existences of charge-transfer intermediate as well as the conical intersection in the vicinity, which has not been observed in other symmetric (or less polar) phenylethylene-based luminophores, are the major features of BIM in solution. While in crystalline phase, the excited-state deactivation channels via torsional motions, either via one-bond rotation or via hula-twist mechanism, are restricted by steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion from surrounding molecules, and thus fluorescence is enhanced. {\textcopyright} 2016 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Assessment of the embodied energy associated with the production and transportation of materials during the design phase of building provides great potential to profoundly affect the building's energy use and sustainability performance. While Building Information Modeling (BIM) gives opportunities to incorporate sustainability performance indicators in the building design process, it lacks interoperability with the conventional Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tools used to analyse the environmental footprints of materials in building design. Additionally, many LCA tools use databases based on industry-average values and thus cannot account for differences in the embodied impacts of specific materials from individual suppliers. To address these issues, this paper presents a framework that supports design decisions and enables assessment of the embodied energy associated with building materials supply chain based on suppliers' Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs). The framework also integrates Extract Transform Load (ETL) technology into the BIM to ensure BIM-LCA interoperability, enabling an automated or semi-automated assessment process. The applicability of the framework is tested by developing a prototype and using it in a case study, which shows that a building's energy use and carbon footprint can be significantly reduced during the design phase by accounting the impact of individual material in the supply chain. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

Most of total life cycle cost (LCC) of these projects is incurred during the operational phase, making these projects lose their economic aspect of sustainability. Decreasing the cost of low income housing projects and taking into consideration the available resources are two cru-cial facets that should be taken into consideration. Therefore, this paper focuses on two aspects of the sustainability of building through its life cycle, which are environmental and economic aspects using environmentally friendly materials in construction. To accomplish this aim, a framework is developed that integrates Building Information Modeling (BIM) with computer simulation, optimization and system dynamics in Low Income Housing (LIH) projects. The developed framework helps in determining LIH project duration and selecting the optimum alternative with to material systems. The sustainability aspects of building are achieved by considering a LCC of these buildings and the number of points that can be awarded under the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) ra-ting system. It aids government and/or contractors in adopting BIM technology to minimize life cycle cost while achieving maximum LEED materials credits points for LIH projects. Social Housing project in Badr City-Egypt is considered as a case study to demon-strate the use of the developed prototype and to illustrate its essential features. The results have shown that selection of sustainable-building materials for the construction has a crucial role in the formation of a sustainable building as they affect the performance of building. Therefore, the Egyptian government should consider building materials with sustainable properties and a low LCC in the de-sign phase to mitigate the negative impacts of LIH projects. {\textcopyright} 2016 ISEIS.

abstract = {The needs to ground construction safety-related decisions under uncertainty on knowledge extracted from objective, empirical data are pressing. Although construction research has considered machine learning (ML) for more than two decades, it had yet to be applied to safety concerns. We applied two state-of-the-art ML models, Random Forest (RF) and Stochastic Gradient Tree Boosting (SGTB), to a data set of carefully featured attributes and categorical safety outcomes, extracted from a large pool of textual construction injury reports via a highly accurate Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool developed by past research. The models can predict injury type, energy type, and body part with high skill (0.236 {\textless} RPSS {\textless} 0.436), outperforming the parametric models found in the literature. The high predictive skill reached suggests that injuries do not occur at random, and that therefore construction safety should be studied empirically and quantitatively rather than strictly being approached through the analysis of subjective data, expert opinion, and with a regulatory and managerial perspective. This opens the gate to a new research field, where construction safety is considered an empirically grounded quantitative science. Finally, the absence of predictive skill for the output variable injury severity suggests that unlike other safety outcomes, injury severity is mainly random, or that extra layers of predictive information should be used in making predictions, like the energy level in the environment. In the context of construction safety analysis, this study makes important strides in that the results provide reliable probabilistic forecasts of likely outcomes should an accident occur, and show great potential for integration with building information modeling and work packaging due to the binary and physical nature of the input variables. Such data-driven predictions had been absent from the field since its inception. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The building industry and facility management is in a state of upheaval: The complexity of the real world is now represented in its digital counterpart. The established object-based file format “Industrial Foundation Classes (IFC)” developed by the International Alliance for Interoperability facilitates interoperability in the context of Building Information Modeling. Unfortunately, there is no feasible workflow for filtering energy-related information, e.g. a streamlined version of the building geometry. Simplification methods often fail on CAD data that is ignorant of domain specific semantic information (i.e. functional differences between a door and stucco are not reflected in the geometry and are therefore often ignored). With EU law now requiring energy performance certificates to be issued for all buildings, energy performance analysis becomes an increasingly important topic. Accurate, yet efficient calculation depends on simple building models. However, typical IFC models contain a lot of irrelevant data, in particular geometric representations, which are too detailed for energy performance analysis. Therefore, we propose an algorithm that extracts input models suitable for calculations directly from IFC models in a semi-automatic process. The key aspect of the algorithm is geometry simplification subject to semantic and functional groups; more specifically, the 3D representations of walls, slabs, windows, doors, etc. are reduced to a collection of surfaces describing the building's thermal shell on one hand, and the material layers associated with it on the other hand. This simplification takes into account semantic constraints and expert knowledge. Furthermore, it works on “real-world” data; i.e. it is robust towards incomplete, imperfect and inconsistent data. {\textcopyright} 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

However, building energy analysis (BEA) is typically conducted late in design, by energy analyst specialists. The ability to try out new ideas early in the design process in order to choose the best alternative is not ordinarily taken advantage of, due to the difficulty and expense of modeling the building and energy systems. Building information modeling (BIM) provides the user with an opportunity to explore different energy saving alternatives in the design process while avoiding the time-consuming process of re-entering all the building geometry, enclosure, and HVAC information necessary for a complete energy analysis. While significant time savings are being made by not having to create the building geometry within the simulation interface in BIM energy modeling simulation, there is a good possibility of missing, misplaced, or deformed building elements during a BIM data exchange process. This research focuses on one of the major limitations – inaccuracies through simplifications in construction/material data – and aims to improve the accuracy of energy modeling process by developing an object based approach in materials in which the energy modeler may change and expand various properties in building materials. In testing the performance of the proposed approach, the results from the proposed energy modeling process in the case study are compared to those of existing energy modeling software which showed significant gains in accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to present a systematic framework for maintenance and refurbishment in domestic housing sector for utilising BIM processes, which tackles ageing housing stock and allows for sustainability improvements, and carbon footprinting. Design/methodology/approach – The methods used consisted using modern technology currently used in the built environment sector, and applying them to BIM framework. The BIM implementation covered both technical and social implications, and appraisal of different approaches needed to make the framework effective within the housing sector. Findings – The study revealed that there are many modern approaches for a BIM framework in relation to maintenance and refurbishment, and a possible strategic BM approach largely used in new built sector can be applied to domestic building to achieve effective modern asset management. This makes the housing stock easier to manage as well as addressing vital issues such as carbon footprint, and excessive energy wasted on inefficient buildings envelopes. Research limitations/implications – Further testing and adoption of the approach and model proposed, will result in greater acceptance of BIM for housing management and greater realisation of benefits. Practical implications – A potential model that can be used and applied to domestic housing sector as a result of this research. Originality/value – Demonstration of a road map for BIM applications within the maintenance and refurbishment for housing stock is currently under researched, and the findings aimed to address such a gap. This can in turn shift the focus of BIM towards asset management and building performance rather than just new build. {\textcopyright} 2016, {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {The development of separate building performance simulation tools has brought about a significant need for the integration of multi-domain simulations that would enable multiple building performance analyses to be conducted from a single building model. Insufficient data integration between the tools and Building Information Modeling (BIM) currently prevents the efficient production of comprehensive building performance analyses. To overcome this problem, a multi-domain simulation tool, effective and efficient data, and a process integration methodology are all required. Object-Oriented Physical Modeling (OOPM) has emerged as a form of object-oriented modeling capable of supporting multiple domain simulations. Adoption of OOPM into building performance simulations with BIM is particularly interesting as a means of facilitating model translations between BIM and BEM (Building Energy Modeling). Specifically, complex data translation from the building topology in BIM to the space boundary conditions in BEM is both labor intensive and time consuming. This research uses case studies to investigate the feasibility of automatically translating a building topology from BIM to OOPM-based BEM.We included numerous preconditions in order to incorporate various object semantic differences into each model translation. Our research indicates that this adoption approach allows seamless model translations from BIM to OOPM-based BEM, which supports efficient and effective thermal simulations and facilitates the reuse of BIM data in multi-domain simulations. {\textcopyright} 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to propose a different method to design buildings by using and enhancing a representational technique called non-manifold topology (NMT). The methodology already exists but is ignored by current building information modelling (BIM) software in favour of a component-based approach. While the topological information embedded within NMT has many uses in the spatial representation of architecture, including building occupancy analysis and structural analysis, the focus in this paper is on the efficacy of NMT in linking design and building performance simulation (BPS). The proposed approach avoids the process of simplifying models produced by BIM software to conduct BPS. In particular, NMT allows for a clear segmentation of a building, unambiguous space boundaries, and perfectly matched surfaces and glazing sub-surfaces. The NMT approach was tested through a software prototype that integrates 3D modelling software and an energy simulation engine. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Author(s).

abstract = {Safe Routes To School (SRTS) programs improve safety and health conditions as well as reduce the energy consumption and CO2 emissions by encouraging more children to walk to school. Implementation of the programs requires improved infrastructure to create a safe walking environment to school. To achieve this goal, program participants should comprehensively and consistently evaluate the existing walking environments to prioritize the infrastructure required for improvement. However, in current practice, this evaluation process is challenging due to the lack of formal representation of the existing walking environments. To overcome this limitation, our research team developed an ontology required for the Building Information Model (BIM) to consistently and completely provide information about the existing walkability. The team applied this ontology to an elementary school in the United States and visualized the existing walkability by integrating BIM and Geographical Information System (GIS). Based on the visualization result, the team was able to explicitly describe the existing walkability to program participants. Consequently, we highlight that the ontology supports the participants in more consistently and comprehensively evaluating the existing walkability required for implementation of SRTS programs. {\textcopyright} 2016, Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Nevertheless, the common goal is to cultivate a competent workforce that possesses the desired knowledge, skills and abilities (KSAs) as the industry is largely embracing BIM. This study explores the project-based learning (PBL) pedagogy in a four-year undergraduate CM curriculum with a special focus on BIM implementation in sustainable design and construction. Through a joint course project, this study examines how PBL may improve critical student learning outcomes (SLOs) pertaining to institutional assessment and program accreditation requirements. Specifically, students in two upper division elective courses collaborated on an ongoing campus project through roleplay as they would in real project teams. Major project deliverables included developing the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification strategy and the BIM project execution plan, performing schematic design, conducting performance simulation for LEED credit compliance, and documenting project information for LEED submittals. Formative and summative assessments were conducted on the PBL pedagogy and the joint course experience in enhancing students' understanding and working knowledge of BIM implementation in the sustainability domain. The joint course project also provided the instructors with opportunities to align course redesign with program accreditation standards. This paper outlines the strategies of implementing and managing a joint course project, and shares various metrics and tools adopted in project evaluation. The results and the findings of this joint course project are expected to shed light on competency-based program assessment and future BIM curriculum innovation. {\textcopyright} 2016 The author.},

abstract = {In recent years, building energy consumption has increased in response to climate change, resulting in a worldwide reduction of energy efficiency. A strong response is required, through both the enhancement of building energy efficiency and the reduction of power usage. These objectives could be achieved by pursuing “Blackout” prevention, through developing a control unit such as that of the urban energy grid system that was used in the Energy Operation Center (EOC) for smart cities. In this context, this paper presents an optimization operation technique for Building Energy Management Systems (BEMS), using control monitor-based Building Information Modeling (BIM) for the efficient operation of the EOC. BIM is one of the approaches that can be used for the visual representation, management, and exchange of information on all aspects of a building. The EOC should be able to efficiently represent the data from the building information, and the operator maintaining it should be able to promptly acquire the data for handling it. This suggests that the control of energy consumption by a Building Automation System (BAS) to maximize building energy efficiency will lead to improved total energy performance, reduced operating costs, and reduced environmental impact. {\textcopyright} 2016, Korean Society for Precision Engineering and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Building information, energy consumption data of the air-conditioning system, and energy consumption data of the plug loads were collected separately. Identification models are developed to predict the real daily energy consumption data. Developed models involve three specific functions to represent the variability of the daily occupancy, the additional occupancy due to visitors and the variation of outdoor air temperature. The performance of the developed identification model is very satisfactory and fits very well with the real energy consumption data. Based on the identification model, key factors which are influencing the energy consumption in institutional buildings are identified as the variability of the daily occupancy, hence a methodology is developed to calculate the occupancy in the building. The identified parameters are used as inputs into deterministic energy simulation programs, like Energy Plus, to perform detailed energy analysis. The whole methodology developed has improved significantly the accuracy of the energy simulation modeling of institutional buildings and has permitted to understand and evaluate the major energy characteristics of these buildings. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Building demolition waste presents a significant challenge due to its large scale. Especially, the treatment of waste (i.e. demolition, collection, sorting, transportation, recycling and landfill) has environmental implications, e.g. carbon emissions due to energy consumed by equipment and vehicles. Therefore, it is imperative to identify the appropriate waste treatment methods with low carbon emissions. However, previous studies predominately focused on quantifying the carbon emission of buildings. In contrast, the carbon emission derived from the treatment of building demolition waste is largely overlooked. A conceptual framework is developed in this study to facilitate the assessment of carbon emissions over the life cycle of building demolition waste. In this conceptual framework, Building Information Modelling provides an effective approach to harvest data and feed into the Life Cycle Assessment. Case study of a high-rise residential building was conducted to showcase how this framework can be implemented in practice. Results showed that the environmental benefit derived from recycling of building demolition waste varies from one material to another. The recycling of metal waste has far higher environmental benefits compared to masonry wastes. In particular, aluminum could contribute to as high as 45{\%} of carbon emission reduction despite only accounting for 0.66{\%} of the total weight. Across various lifecycle stages, the onsite collection and sorting is the biggest contributor to the total carbon emission. In addition, on-site recycling has better performance compared to factory recycling and landfill in terms of carbon emissions. Furthermore, a large scale inventories are developed as an outcome of this case study. These findings provide useful inputs to the future endeavor of building demolition waste recycling in a bid to reduce the associated carbon emissions. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Reduction in the carbon emissions from Australian buildings is thus a priority for the Federal government. In Australia the government recently announced plan to cut emissions by 26-28 per cent by 2030 (Federal Politics, 2015). This study concerns energy use in building construction and the degree of carbon emissions reduction that can be achieved through use of bioclimatic principles. Criteria of the model proposed in this research have been developed through analyzing bioclimatic principles to measure the potential construction carbon emissions that can be reduced in pre-construction and construction (cradle to site) stages during the lifecycle stages of a building. The developed model examines six case studies from Australia and the UK. The outcomes of this research clearly shows that by use of bioclimatic principles up to 65 per cent reduction in construction carbon emissions can be achieved for a whole building systems (floor, wall and roof), while current best construction practice (i.e. a graded by Green Star) at the highest level achieve less than 32 per cent reduction. However the future of the green construction industry lies on taking into account the bioclimatic principles- such as replacing conventional building materials with more energy efficient materials (i.e. replacing Portland cement with geopolymer based cement); reusing the recycled construction materials; reducing transportation and other similar initiatives. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Energy audits are generally considered the initial step of energy retrofits projects, paving the way for more detailed energy analysis and design. However, there are few standards to define the input and output data for energy auditing, making it difficult to leverage the data from an energy audit in the initial feasibility stage. Moreover, with the increasing use of building information modeling, the information exchange should be aligned with the future potential to support building information modeling implementation. This article describes the research on a standardized data structure for walk-through energy audits to help define the information exchange between energy audit data collection and energy analysis tools, namely EnergyPlus. The building information modeling-enabled energy modeling information exchange requirements were also compared with the current energy audit data structure to identify the gaps and overlaps. This research found that only 41{\%} of collected data could be transferred for energy modeling, and only 26{\%} of the input data that are required by EnergyPlus were captured by current energy audit practice. The alignment of data was even less when compared with the information exchange requirement of the building information modeling-enabled energy modeling. The reasons for the low alignment are discussed in this article and the future research directions are suggested. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2016 ASHRAE.},

abstract = {The amount of energy that buildings consume is currently attracting significant interest throughout the world, and considerable attention is being devoted to the development of green buildings to reduce energy consumption; however, the current process being used to conduct building energy analysis has a significant shortcoming in that it cannot directly use building information modelling (BIM)-based representational data that includes a curved wall. Currently, the curved wall must be converted into segmented straight walls (SSWs) in the building model in order for the building energy analysis (BEA) program to be able to recognize and use the data. In this paper, we have proposed a segmentation process for curved walls in industry foundation classes (IFC)-based BIM for BEA. The proposed process consists of three sub-processes: 1) extracting data from the IFC model; 2) dividing the curved wall into several segmented straight walls; and 3) generating an INP file as a building description for DOE-2.2-based BEA. The proposed process will enable the engineers who are responsible for BEA to use a BIM-based model directly in the BEA program without having to do additional work. The proposed process can help ensure that the BEA results are accurate and reliable. {\textcopyright} 2016 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press.},

abstract = {Heterocyclic compounds are known as proton transfer species for anhydrous polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM), for which efficient proton conductivity at high operating temperature has yet to be found. The present work proposes an approach to enhance the proton transfer of the membrane by combining the concept of proton donor and acceptor with an ordered structure, i.e. layer-by-layer (LbL). By simply applying poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) as a polymeric proton donor and benzimidazole (BIm) conjugated on branching poly(ethyleneimine) as a polymeric proton acceptor and alternately coating the sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK), a LbL membrane can be obtained. The proton transfer can be fine-tuned by the number of bilayers, and at that time, the 20-bilayered SPEEK/BIm-PEI/PAA is an optimal condition, which achieves a balance between the hydrogen bond and chain mobility under LbL packing that allows a 1.5 higher order of magnitude conductivity than an as-prepared SPEEK membrane even at a high operating temperature range (90-170°C). The present work, for the first time, shows how a simple LbL technique is practical for constructing high-ordered structure of proton donor and acceptor species on the membrane surface for the efficient proton transfer in a PEM.

abstract = {Green buildings should respect nature and endeavor to mitigate harmful effects to the environment and occupants. This is often interpreted as creating sustainable sites, consuming less energy and water, reusing materials, and providing excellent indoor environmental quality. Environmentally friendly buildings should also consider literally the impact that they have on birds, millions of them. A major factor in bird collisions with buildings is the choice of building materials. These choices are usually made by the architect who may not be aware of the issue or may be looking for guidance from certification programs such as LEED. As a proof of concept for an educational tool, we developed a software-assisted approach to characterize whether a proposed building design would earn a point for the LEED Pilot Credit 55: Avoiding Bird Collisions. Using the visual programming language Dynamo with the common building information modeling software Revit, we automated the assessment of designs. The approach depends on parameters that incorporate assessments of bird threat for fa{\c{c}}ade materials, analyzes building geometry relative to materials, and processes user input on building operation to produce the assessment. {\textcopyright} 2016, College Publishing.

At the same time, the building information modeling paradigm is aiming to develop comprehensive digital representations of building characteristics based on semantic 3D models. Most of the data required for energy performance calculation can be found in such models; however, extracting the relevant data is not a trivial problem. This article presents an algorithm to prepare input data for energy analysis based on building information models. The crucial aspect is geometric simplification according to semantic constraints: the building element geometries are reduced to a set of surfaces representing the thermal shell as well as the internal boundaries. These boundary parts are then associated with material layers and thermally relevant data.

abstract = {In addition to the global awareness regarding green buildings, there is growing interest in Building Energy Load Calculation (BELC). The BELC process, however, has several potential problems, including the fact that the required data are input manually through subjective engineer choices and, during the BELC process, a designer must wait for feedback from the engineer regarding the BELC results. This paper addresses these problems by proposing a BIM-based building energy load calculation system for designers. To that end, the required data for BELC are divided into four types: general, space, material, and element. According to the required data, input methodologies are categorized as either automatic type-A or manual type-M data. The proposed system for BELC is developed with four key functions: type-A data input, type-M data input, material-property matching, and calculation functions. To validate the proposed system, two designers with more than seven years of practical experience and a BELC engineer using the eQUEST and EnergyPLUS programs applied the model to the current and proposed approaches. The proposed system contributes to increasing the efficiency of the BELC process by facilitating self-check by the designer and by reducing the need for engineering input during the BELC process. {\textcopyright} 2016, Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Current research regarding the impact of orientation on a building's energy needs seldom tap into the potential of BIM. This study investigates the impact of orientation on energy consumption in small-scale construction, and assesses how BIM can be used to facilitate this process. The methods adopted are three-fold. Firstly, a real-life building is modelled using Revit, one of the leading BIM tools. Secondly, through green building Extensible Markup Language, the model is exported to Green Building Studio, one of the leading energy simulation software. Thirdly, in the Green Building Studio, different building orientations are adopted and their impacts of the whole building energy are investigated. Based on the analysis of the energy consumption corresponding to the different orientations, it emerged that a well-orientated building can save a considerable amount of energy throughout its life cycle. Specifically, a total electricity use difference of 17 056 kWh and a total gas use difference of 27 988 MJ leading to a combined energy cost savings of {\pounds}878 throughout a 30 year period between the best (+180°) and worst (+45°) orientations of the building was achieved. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Buildings are responsible for more than 40{\%} of global energy usage and as much as 33{\%} of global greenhouse gas emissions in both developed and developing countries. However, the study of carbon emissions over a building's life cycle based on Ecotect and building information modeling in developing areas of Nanjing has yet to be conducted. Therefore, the results and recommendations of this paper represent a contribution to the literature on this topic. The scientific value of this paper is that Ecotect and building information modeling can be helpful in simplifying the estimation of carbon emissions over a building's life cycle because they can provide a majority of the information and calculation tools necessary for performing an life cycle assessment (LCA), which may alleviate the problem of insufficient information when executing an LCA of a building. A sensitivity analysis was performed by changing several parameters to identify the parameters that have the largest impacts on the performance a building. A comparison of the life cycle carbon emissions for each stage showed that the operational stage is the largest contributor to carbon emissions. Approximately 85.4{\%} of the total carbon emissions were generated during operation. The construction stage accounted for 12.6{\%} of the total carbon emissions. Approximately 2{\%} of the total carbon emissions occurred during the demolition stage. Compared to the total carbon emissions over the entire life cycle of the building, carbon sequestration by vegetation was minimal. Thus, these findings indicate that governments can achieve the greatest reductions in carbon emissions by targeting the operational phase of buildings. However, the opportunity for addressing non-operational phases should not be ignored because the average carbon emissions per working area per year of non-operational stages are far greater than those of the use phase. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Approximately forty percent of total building energy consumption is attributed to HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems that aim to maintain healthy and comfortable indoor environments. An HVAC system is a network with several subsystems, and there exist heat transfer and balance among the zones of a building, as well as heat gains and losses through a building's envelope. Diverse occupancy (diversity in terms of when and how occupants occupy a building) in spaces could result in increase of loads that are not actual demands for an HVAC system, leading into inefficiencies. This paper introduces a framework to quantitatively evaluate the energy implications of occupancy diversity at the building level, where building information modeling is integrated to provide building geometries, HVAC system layouts, and spatial information as inputs for computing potential energy implications if occupancy diversity were to be eliminated. An agglomerate hierarchical clustering-based iterative evaluation algorithm is designed for iteratively eliminating occupancy diversity. Whole building energy simulations for a real-world building, as well as virtual reference buildings demonstrate that the proposed framework could effectively quantify the HVAC system energy efficiency affected by occupancy diversity and the framework is generalizable to different building geometries, layouts, and occupancy diversities. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

The article describes a new way of teaching architectural design of energy-efficient buildings, with the use of modern supporting tools. Designing a building as an energy-efficient structure has become common today, for environmental, economic and social reasons, as well as being a reaction to legislation. The problem is that the traditional way of designing, taught to this day at many universities does not allow for the design of such buildings. For this reason, there is a need to develop a new method of teaching, which requires a reorganisation of the design process. This is connected with the need to use appropriate tools to support the design process and to shift the main burden of decisions to the earliest stage of design. These tools include computer software in the BIM (building information modelling) standard and related programmes, through which it is possible to perform a series of simulations for a virtual model of the building concerning its energy efficiency. {\textcopyright} WIETE 2016.},

abstract = {Energy consumption by and emissions from buildings contribute greatly to environmental degradation. Currently, an important tool in the study of architectural conservation design is LCA (life-cycle assessment), with the goal of minimizing energy consumption and environmental impact. The research suggests a method to apply LCA analysis and BIM technology to design 3D BIM models and define the relationship between BIM elements and architectural materials. The obvious advantages of combining BIM with LCA have resulted in its wide use for building life cycle assessment. The study propose here quantitative analysis of environmental impact by construction and build an index database for environmental impact assessment of building projects based on analytical hierarchy process. The design plan of the Teaching and Research Building of a University in Nanjing China is taken as the example to calculate energy consumption in response models formed from construction data. From these modeled calculations, then the key environmental impact factors were analyzed. The objective is to suggest an integrated solution to BIM-based environmental impact assessment of building construction and also provide a theoretical support for optimized building design.

abstract = {In recent years, there has been increasing awareness of the importance of using information technology in improving "green building" performance in terms of design, construction, and operation. Assessment tools help industry stakeholders evaluate the performance of green buildings. Building information modeling (BIM) enables architecture, engineering, and construction managers to evaluate the performance of green buildings during preconstruction. BIM-based sustainable analysis extracts the data from a building model, which supports the assessment for green building certification. This paper explores the use of BIM with other assessment tools, such as Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, BEAM Plus and Green Star. The study also examines the potential use of BIM in green building rating systems and the possibility of achieving credit via BIM tools and analysis software. In a case study of a construction project, using green building assessment tools integrated with BIM has led to an improved green building and facilitated the performance assessment of this building during the certification process. {\textcopyright} 2006-2016 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

abstract = {With the construction industry moving rapidly towards building information modelling (BIM), pursuit of sustainability in buildings will require the use of renewable energy analysis tools in the early stages of building design as well as establishment of BIM-compliant practices. Planning for sunlight use is essential to obtain sustainable benefits from the sun in and around buildings, which process requires understanding and making allowances in building attributes that affect how sunlight can be used. This paper presents a model for simulation of sunlight's effect on building design under BIM technology, while calculating the potential energy capacity of roof- and fa{\c{c}}ade-mounted photovoltaic solar panels. For this purpose, it is suggested in the study to use statistical construction data as well as 3D digital models obtained from BIM software (Revit and THSWARE) to measure the useful sunlight duration and derivable energy of representative samples of buildings. By measuring the solar energy absorbed by the building facades, the electricity converted from solar energy and collateral savings can be calculated. Taking the cost of solar panels and feasibility of the project into consideration, this study shows using solar panels of a certain quality contributes greatly to social, economic and environmental benefits. {\textcopyright} 2016, Scibulcom Ltd.

The energy-related credit is approximately 30{\%} of the total and also the energy simulation ratio specifically is the highest among the single credits as it is 20{\%}. In this research, the energy simulation process using Building Information Modeling (BIM) based on the energy simulation case performed at the A-Tower, LEED certification was proposed. It places an emphasis on the verification process which was short in the previous research. The architectural geometry modeled through the BIM tool is converted to the gbXML, and in this process the geometry is verified through the interference check functions, the gbXML Viewer and the FZKViewer. The energy simulation is performed after the verification procedure. The geometry verification process in the A-Tower project is presented throughout this paper. In conclusion, an improved process is proposed for the productivity and reliability of energy simulation. {\textcopyright} 2016 by the authors.},

abstract = {Energy efficient buildings rely on simulation to predict energy performance. However, problems associated with simulation tools can lead to surprises when discrepancies are found between actual and predicted building energy performance; this frustrates building owners, investors, and designers. A probabilistic method of risk assessment for the calculation of energy use intensity and total utility cost in energy performance has been developed. Sensitive and uncertain parameters were selected and given a probability distribution instead of one fixed value for the simulations. Latin hypercube sampling was used to generate input combinations with parameter values picked stochastically from distributions based on the Monte Carlo method. With these input combinations, 10,000 simulations on seven distributed parameters were run using a cloud processing service. The output data, energy use intensity and energy cost, were analyzed using curve-fitting techniques to find a best-fit distribution, which could be used for risk analysis of energy performance and cost. The results illustrate the probability and reliability of prediction within a specific range. Instead of relying on a single value, these curves would help designers better evaluate design alternatives, and the probability distribution of energy performance and cost would be useful in making decisions about investments for energy efficient projects. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach: A building simulation approach in conjunction with a hypothetical case study using BIM software (Autodesk Revit) was adopted to identify primary housing information data set and to examine how housing information data set is processed within a BIM system. Findings: Housing information data set such as physical dimensions, energy performance, associated costs, risk level, weather data and other relevant data should be prepared at the outset of a project to determine the most cost effective refurbishment solution. Furthermore, BIM can enable both clients and construction professionals to make informed decisions about diverse climate risk resistant options by providing reliable cost estimations of them at the early design stage. Research limitations/implications: Actual housing information for the BIM simulation is limited, and as a result, hypothetical housing information based on the UK Government data were used instead. Practical implications: This research will provide essential housing information data set to utilize BIM effectively and efficiently for refurbishing climate risk vulnerable housing. Originality/value: This research explores possibility to utilize BIM for climate risk mitigation in the housing sector, and reveals primary housing information data set for BIM to develop a climate resistant housing refurbishment solution. {\textcopyright} 2016, {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) has become a valuable data source for urban data acquisition. A method was proposed in this research for building extraction based on object oriented classification with decision rules. A model has been developed using object oriented classification and is implemented using QGIS. Using Lastools, Envi 5.1 and QGIS 2.10, multiple images were derived from LiDAR data. A total of 30 feature attributes have been generated only 8 of the 30 possible attributes were used, resulted in a classification based on the total group of attributes (raw 3D point clouds data captured by laser scanning and LiDAR-derived features (Digital Surface Model and Digital Terrain Model, textures from Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix) as well as the area of building≥ a threshold and building shape has been also used. Three classes were identified for the study area: Building, trees and power lines. The proposed method was evaluated using some buildings of used data set and the results proved high efficiency and reliability of the proposed method for extraction of buildings. The results show that the proposed method has very high classification accuracy. Particularly, the overall classification accuracy was 92{\%}, and the Kappa coefficient was 0.93. Additionally, both producer accuracy and user accuracy were higher than 86{\%} for buildings class. By counting the extracted buildings in the study area using the model, it was seen that 91{\%} of buildings were extracted automatically. It was found that a good result could be achieved from the developed method. {\textcopyright} 2016, North Atlantic University Union. All rights reserved.},

The so called 'information gap' about the costs and benefits of energy-saving activities could explain the difference. Audit programs have been undertaken to overcome the 'information gap' but, surprisingly, most papers analyzing the impact of audits on the adoption of energy-saving measures use faulty methods that could provide biased results. In this paper we fill this gap of the energy literature. First, we introduce robust counterfactual methods to analyze the impact of energy-saving policies; second, we apply these methods to investigate the impact of the free-funding of audits on the energy-saving investments of local public administrations, a neglected area of investigation. As opposite to most of the literature, we cannot identify any statistically significant effect of the audits either on the number of energy-saving interventions or on the resources devoted to these activities by local public administrations. We believe that, in the field of public non-residential buildings, information is not sufficient to fostering public investments aimed at increasing energy efficiency. As a policy consequence, public resources should consider different tools, including those aimed at reducing the cost of investments. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The increase in global environmental concerns as well as the advancement of computational tools and methods have had significant impacts on the way in which buildings are being designed. Building professionals are increasingly expected to improve energy performance of their design. To achieve a high level of energy performance, multidisciplinary simulation-based optimization can be utilized to help designers in exploring more design alternatives and making informed decisions. Because of the high complexity in setting up a building model for multi-objective design optimization, there is a great demand of utilizing and integrating the advanced modeling and simulation technologies, including BIM, parametric modeling, cloud-based simulation, and optimization algorithms, as well as a new user interface that facilitates the setup of building parameters (decision variables) and performance fitness functions (design objectives) for automatically generating, evaluating, and optimizing multiple design options. This paper presents an integrated framework for building information modeling (BIM)-based performance optimization, BPOpt. This framework enables designers to explore design alternatives using an open-source, visual programming user interface on the top of a widely used BIM platform, to generate models of building design options, assess the environmental performance of the models through cloud-based simulation, and search for the most appropriate design alternatives. This paper details the process of the development of BPOpt and also provides a case study to show its application. The case study demonstrates the use of BPOpt in minimizing the energy consumption while maximizing the appropriate daylighting level for a residential building. Finally, strengths, limitations, current adoption by academia and industry, and future improvements of BPOpt for high-performance building design are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Background: The architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry lacks a framework for capturing, managing, and exchanging project, product, and social information over the lifecycle of a building. The current tools have various limitations, such as lack of interoperability, slow to transfer huge building model files, and possibility of data inconsistency. Methods: In this paper, we present a cloud-based BIM server framework namely Social BIMCloud that facilitates BIM information exchange through dynamic merging and splitting of building models. The data model of Social BIMCloud is based on but not limited to IFC. The data model of Social BIMCloud was further extended to accommodate social interactions, by studying the formal modes of communication in the AEC industry. An object-based approach to capture and manage social interactions in AEC projects through a BIM-based visual user interface was also developed and demonstrated. Results: Social BIMCloud addresses the issues of inefficient data transfer speed and data inconsistency in a distributed environment by facilitating the storage and partial exchange of integrated nD BIM models. Data interoperability is facilitated through open BIM standards such as IFC and direct integration with construction software. High performance, scalability, fault tolerance, and cost effectiveness are facilitated through data partitioning, data replication strategies, multi-node structures, and pay-per-use tariff systems, respectively, through a cloud-based NoSQL database. Conclusion: The Social BIMCloud framework helps to develop and exchange BIM models, which are rich in project information such as social interactions, cost, and energy analyses. This framework improves the communication efficiency between project participants, leading to better designs and less rework. The information captured by this framework could also be useful to determine important metrics such as industry trends, relationships among project participants, and user requirements. {\textcopyright} 2015, Das et al.; licensee Springer.},

abstract = {To be sustainable in energy usage in the future, there are two aspects that need to be considered: the energy supply or generation and the consumption side, including the closely linked construction and building industries which consume a large amount of energy. Essential requirements for energy efficiency are to produce less greenhouse gas emissions and to rely more on renewable energy sources for future sustainability. Policies for mitigation of the environment impact are having effects on both the supply and demand. While the former requires more alternate sources in smart grids and improved technologies for carbon capture and storage, the latter involves the reduction of energy wastes and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as prerequisites to green certification within the construction and building sector. Thus, access to sustainable, affordable, and secure energy is one of the major global strategic priorities to maintain and improve public health, sustain economic growth, and mitigate the effects of climate change. Toward this goal, many countries, including Australia, are investing in clean, efficient, reliable energy systems for a prosperous and environmentally sustainable future. Hence, exploring various options to ensure energy security by diversification of energy sources is an important step in meeting the future requirements and delivering clean energy to different industry sectors. This paper discusses options to manage the use of energy sources in the power generation and construction industries. Options for mitigation of environmental impact and for achievement of sustainable energy usage, such as building design with BIM, are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

A large number of both public and private organizations have published their data following the Linked Data principles, or have done so with data from other organizations. To this extent, since the generation and publication of Linked Data are intensive engineering processes that require high attention in order to achieve high quality, and since experience has shown that existing general guidelines are not always sufficient to be applied to every domain, this paper presents a set of guidelines for generating and publishing Linked Data in the context of energy consumption in buildings (one aspect of Building Information Models). These guidelines offer a comprehensive description of the tasks to perform, including a list of steps, tools that help in achieving the task, various alternatives for performing the task, and best practices and recommendations. Furthermore, this paper presents a complete example on the generation and publication of Linked Data about energy consumption in buildings, following the presented guidelines, in which the energy consumption data of council sites (e.g., buildings and lights) belonging to the Leeds City Council jurisdiction have been generated and published as Linked Data. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier B.V.

While belief propagation (BP) holds great potential for forming a powerful underlying mechanism for such distributed in-network inferences in WSNs, one major challenge is how to systematically improve the energy efficiency of BP-based in-network inference in WSNs. In this paper, we first propose a systematic and rigorous data-driven approach to building information models for WSN applications upon which BP-based in-network inference can be effectively and efficiently performed. We then present a wavelet-based BP framework for multiresolution inference, with respect to our WSN information modeling, to further reduce WSNs' energy. We empirically evaluate our proposed WSN information modeling and wavelet-based BP framework/multiresolution inference using real-world sensor network data. The results demonstrate the merits of our proposed approaches. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are a key part of the Internet of Things vision which aims at bridging together the physical and the digital worlds in several application domains. In the building automation field, WSNs are widely adopted for energy optimization, safety and security purposes, and could greatly benefit from existing information already available in preexisting building information models (BIMs). Such BIMs are normally developed during the building design phase and reused continuously during the construction and operation phases of the building life-cycle. In current deployments, however, due to lack of interoperability such information (e.g., walls geometry, materials, and so on) must often be recollected and reinputed by WSN commissioning specialists. Open development and planning tools and methodologies can play a key role in fostering interoperability and convergence of BIM and WSN systems. This paper aims at demonstrating how increased interoperability between WSN development-support tools and BIM systems could provide advantages to developers, integrators, domain specialist, and BIM users. The methodology is validated by applying a newly proposed tool exploiting BIM interoperability to support the planning of the topology of a WSN based on ultrawideband technologies. The proposed approach is evaluated through a small-scale experimentation held in a historical building in Torino (Italy). {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

abstract = {Purpose – This research paper is a literature review of the existing building retrofitting process. It proposes studying the functional, technical, and organizational issues of the green retrofit process. The purpose of this paper is to expand the domain of design framework for retrofitting existing buildings. Design/methodology/approach – The paper provides a review of the model-based design process from enrollment to evaluation stages representing the green retrofitting process in selected publications. The paper opted to review the Green Retrofit Design (GRD) process model for achieving a systematic design model of GRD development in the future. Findings – Functional and maintenance issues are mainly for new buildings, also in the field for renovation and demolishing. Publications also show that environmental, social, and technical issues are often examined separately in the decision process of GRD. Papers in the facility management scale would concentrate more on organization/legal issues. Publications with questionnaire design are devoted to the usage on life-cycle assessment on existing building, but not yet on the stakeholder management and design process and related issues. Social implications – The achievement of the study is to provide a new framework of design approach that is significant to the theoretical research, education, communication, and practical works in terms of GRD development. Originality/value – The paper not only achieves a specific sequence of practical approaches, including awareness of problems, conceptual development, and design embodiment, to meet design objectives, but also conforms to academic practice-based research of creative design taking on GRD practice. {\textcopyright} 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {Historic Building Information Modelling (HBIM) is limited by the irrelevance of object libraries and the inability of 3D scans to determine structures in buildings of dissimilar age and construction. The potential for energy conscious initiatives to make informed judgments regarding the ‘deep renovation' of traditional buildings requires development of better noninvasive appraisal methods. Presumptions are dangerous for the majority of forms of historic building construction, yet older buildings benefit from better statutory control against alteration in any event. Here it is proposed that the pre-existing standard methods of nineteenth- and early twentieth-century construction could improve capacity to build data for a significant number of buildings of that era. The matching of images to develop place recognition algorithms has been deployed in a number of contexts. Standards, Patents and Specifications provide the means for developing new object libraries nested and shared from the surface to the structure. The example of decorative finishes, commonly used in public buildings at the turn of the twentieth century, demonstrates a traceable route whereby classifications could be determined using historic specifications and product data. The wider potential for such groundwork to enhance capacity to model energy performance of these less well protected buildings is suggested. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Although visual programming is being broadly implemented in other disciplines, it has only relatively recently become an important supplement to three-dimensional modeling programs in the architecture, engineering, and construction industry. Currently, Grasshopper in conjunction with Rhino is a leading example of a visual programming environment that is strongly supported by a user community that is developing additional functionality, but Grasshopper does not yet work directly with building information modeling (BIM) software. Dynamo is relatively new, but shows considerable promise in becoming a constructive tool to complement BIM, 3D modeling, and analysis programs because it includes parametric geometries and works with Revit, a leading BIM software program. Three case studies are described: extensibility of Dynamo through the use of a building energy simulation package, controlling a virtual model's response through light level sensors, and interactively updating shading components for a building facade based on solar angles. They demonstrate that one can work directly within building information models (BIM) using a visual programming language through updating component parameters. These case studies demonstrate the feasibility of a workflow for sustainable design simulations that is different than that more commonly used -- having a separation between design and analysis models and using a neutral file format exchange such as IFC or gbXML to transfer data. As visual programming languages are still a bit uncommon in the building industry, a short background is provided to place them within the tool set of other customizable tools that designers have been developing. {\textcopyright} 2015, College Publishing.

abstract = {One of the challenges in sustainability analysis and its development is the optimum selection of sustainable materials to meet the project's requirements while doing sustainable design. This can only be achieved when project team adopt the use of a strategic approach while selecting the materials, although this could be a complex task for decision makers. Building Information Modeling (BIM) offers designers the ability to assess different design alternatives at the conceptual stage of a project. As a method of integration and through its modeling techniques, BIM can be used to assess the impacts of design alternatives on the energy saving of buildings all over their life. Furthermore, BIM has the potential to help designers select the right type of materials during the early design stage, and make vital decisions when selecting the materials that have sustainable impact on the building's life cycle. The main purpose of this study is to propose a methodology that integrates BIM with decision-making problem-solving approaches (i.e. Entropy-TOPSIS) in order to efficiently optimize the selection of sustainable building components at the conceptual design stage of building projects. Therefore, a Decision Support System (DSS) is developed by using Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques to aid the design team decide on and select the optimum type of sustainable building components and design families while doing conceptual design of proposed projects, based on three main criteria (i.e. environmental factors, economic factors-"cost efficiency," and social well-being) in an attempt to identify the influence of design variations on the whole building's sustainable performance. The multi-criteria procedure embedded in the DSS relies on numerical models to simulate alternative situations, as well as ranking the alternatives and select the best ones based on both the owners' strategic preferences and the availability of sustainable materials in the market. The set of models included in the DSS describes the relationship between sustainability criteria, manufacturers' sustainable materials and the interactions between project team that take place during the design of sustainable building projects. This paper aims at exposing the feasibility of using BIM for analysing the life cycle costs of sustainable buildings at the conceptual stage. The design alternatives suggested by the DSS are evaluated in an integrated environment that joins BIM concept and Life Cycle Cost (LCC) method to analyze the operational cost of the whole building. An actual building project is used to validate the workability and capability of the proposed methodology. {\textcopyright} 2015 The author.},

In order to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of this method, a case study of an office building is conducted in Hong Kong.

At the same time, the building energy consumption accounts for the proportion of total energy consumption is increasing, building energy conservation has become an important part of the national energy conservation strategy. Based on this, this paper studies the energy saving application of small high-rise office building based on BIM model. Based on a brief summary of the current research background of building energy conservation and related theories and technologies, a small high-rise office building in Wuhan area is taken as an example, the information model of 3D - BIM based on BIM technology is described in detail, through the information conversion, the model is introduced into the BIM subsystem - Ecotect green building application software, so that the corresponding building energy efficiency analysis model is obtained. In addition, the energy consumption analysis of air conditioning system of the building is carried out in consideration of the influence factors of the small high-rise office building. The results show that the energy saving analysis based on BIM is intuitive and detailed for building energy efficiency information analysis, which provides a scientific basis for the design of building energy planning for building structure. {\textcopyright} 2015, UK Simulation Society.

abstract = {It has been a consensus in cancer research that cancer is a disease caused primarily by genomic alterations, especially somatic mutations. However, the mechanism of mutation-induced oncogenesis is not fully understood. Here, we used the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway as a case study and performed a systematic analysis of integrating pathway dynamics with protein interaction kinetics to quantitatively investigate the causal molecular mechanism of mutationinduced oncogenesis. A mathematical model of the regulatory network was constructed to establish the functional role of dynamic bifurcation in the apoptotic process. The oncogenic mutation enrichment of each of the protein functional domains involved was found strongly correlated with the parameter sensitivity of the bifurcation point. We further dissected the causal mechanism underlying this correlation by evaluating the mutational influence on protein interaction kinetics using molecular dynamics simulation. We analyzed 29 matched mutant-wild-type and 16 matched SNP-wild-type protein systems. We found that the binding kinetics changes reflected by the changes of free energy changes induced by protein interaction mutations, which induce variations in the sensitive parameters of the bifurcation point, were a major cause of apoptosis pathway dysfunction, and mutations involved in sensitive interaction domains show high oncogenic potential. Our analysis provided a molecular basis for connecting protein mutations, protein interaction kinetics, network dynamics properties, and physiological function of a regulatory network. These insights provide a framework for coupling mutation genotype to tumorigenesis phenotype and help elucidate the logic of cancer initiation.},

Among building features, lightning management is a crucial element for energy saving. In this paper, an algorithm for the automatic detection of ceiling lightings is developed and tested. The main sections of the algorithm consist of ceiling extraction, point cloud to image conversion, and luminaires detection. Ceiling extraction is performed using RANSAC algorithm for plane detection. Point cloud conversion uses nearest neighbor rasterization and image binarization. The final step deals with luminaires detection and considers two types of lightning present in the dataset: fluorescent lightings are distinguished using a refined Harris corner detector while a Hough transformation is applied to find circular low energy bulbs. The algorithm results reflect a completeness of 100{\%} with a geometric accuracy of 5.8 cm in the centroid determination of fluorescent lighting and 3.0 cm in low energy bulbs. The computing time ranges from 148.8 s in the detection of the fluorescent lighting to 105.9 s for the case of low energy bulbs, with point clouds of 90 and 60 million points, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The innovation of building information modelling (BIM) technology provides a new means of predicting, managing and monitoring the environmental impacts of project construction and development through virtual prototyping/visualisation technology. This paper aims to provide thought-provoking insights into the shortcomings in the scope of the existing green BIM literature, and outlines the most important directions for future research. A total of 84 green-BIM-related papers have been reviewed and compared. Most green BIM research, centres on environmental performance at the design (44 papers) and construction stages (25 papers) of building lifecycles. Few studies concentrated on the development of BIM-based tools for managing environmental performance during the building maintenance, retrofitting (8 papers), and demolition (12 papers) stages. It is suggested that a 'one-stop-shop' BIM for environmental sustainability monitoring and management over a building's full life cycle should be considered in future research. Future green BIM tools should also include the three R's concept (reduce, reuse and recycle) in their sustainability analysis for both new development and retrofitting projects. The system should offer better integration with facility operation maintenance manuals for more effective low-carbon management. The use of cloud-based BIM technology to enable the management of building sustainability using 'big data' is also needed. Despite these potential developments, it is argued that the lack of computer tools and the complications of the BIM models are hindering the adoption of green BIM. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Current state-of-the-art concrete recycling technology provides decision makers with the option to produce coarse recycled concrete aggregates (RCAs) with different qualities through variations in the number of crushing stages or the use of beneficiation processes available. Variations in the recycling process may significantly affect the economic and environmental impacts of the concrete recycling strategy. This, together with variations in transportation requirements from one project to another, makes it impossible to draw general conclusions about the sustainability of a concrete recycling strategy. This paper proposes a computational method for identifying the optimal concrete recycling method by considering the trade-off between costs, energy use and carbon dioxide emissions of concrete recycling in a particular project. After estimating the amount of various grades of the recyclable concrete available using the data made available by building information models, a computational algorithm is applied to identify alternative feasible concrete recycling methods to produce different RCA qualities and to estimate the costs, energy use and carbon dioxide emissions associated with each recycling method. The latter will then serve as decision-making criteria for selection of the best feasible concrete recycling method. The proposed computational method is applied to an illustrative example.},

abstract = {The process of building design is currently undergoing some major changes. In an attempt to mitigate climate change, the design of more sustainable buildings is advocated by the UK government. Furthermore, standalone design methods are being replaced with the concept of Building Information Modelling (BIM). The adoption of BIM has been documented to result in many benefits, which range from time to cost savings. During the initial planning stages, building performance simulation (BPS) can be used to inform design decisions. Data can be exchanged between BIM and BPS tools using data transfer schemas such as the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC). The IFC schema lacks an energy domain, and as a result, an extension is proposed in this paper. This contains energy concepts from a BPS tool called Passive House Planning Package (PHPP). The extended schema was developed by way of an externally coupled Java tool, which facilitates the transfer of data, and informs the building design decision-making process. The process of geometry extraction has been validated with several case studies, which are based on certified Passivhaus buildings in Hannover Kronsberg, Germany and Ebbw Vale, Wales. The amount of error is acceptable, and it is mostly due to differences in the initial BIM model setup, not due to the processing of IFC files. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The case study focuses on documenting the implementation of a teaching module focused on energy modeling in which students modify location, insulation, and window glazing of a single family home preprogramed into BIM software. After instructor demonstration, students perform an EM analysis for additional locations as homework and answer a question set based on their EM results. The results indicate that students had minor issues interpreting the EM results because they did not fully examine the outputs produced from the energy model to inform their answers on the teaching module homework assignment. Overall, however, research findings suggest that implementing such a teaching module can improve student confidence and perception of EM use in construction delivery decisions.

abstract = {One of the biggest global issues at present involves the search for measures to conserve energy and to combat climate change. Because of an increase in natural disasters and energy use, architects and engineers have been focusing more on creating green buildings with low-carbon designs. Building information modeling (BIM) is used to record all of the data related to buildings from the early design stage. This information can be used to respond to energy simulation feedback and to accommodate changes that may be necessary during the design developments. To mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and to conserve energy in the buildings, the application of a BIM-based low-carbon design technique is required from the early design stage. However, the existing research is limited to sub-segmented topics; therefore, it is difficult for designers to establish a rank grade for a low-carbon design technique that is required for application in design planning. In this study, we attempt to analyze the rank grade and the correlation among design components that affect a building's energy performance. We selected tower buildings for the experiment, as they consume a massive amount of energy and have a large impact on the surrounding environment. We analyzed the values that resulted from different shapes, scales, slenderness ratios, window-to-wall ratios, and solar orientations of the tower buildings. Then, we identified a correlation and rank grade among different design components. Architects can maximize energy performance efficiency by considering and applying the rank grade of a low-carbon design technique during design planning. In addition, the development of guidelines for green BIM would reduce confusion in the decision-making process and design modification during the stages of design development, which would then minimize the cost. Furthermore, it is expected that this study can be used to create a database for the realization of green buildings. {\textcopyright} 2015, College Publishing. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {During the many phases in the lifecycle of a building, an ever growing number of dynamic and static aspects are encountered that seem worthy of modelling in a computer-readable representation. Product models that attempt to cover the concepts from the many disciplines or phases in a product's lifecycle face a dilemma, namely maintaining a balance between growing model complexity on the one hand, and user requests for additional concept coverage on the other. In examining the main principles of model theory (Stachowiak 1973) more closely, this paper tries to identify tendencies that may hamper the balance between complexity and completeness. However, a scientific evaluation of model complexity needs objective measures. Metrics for the assessment of software complexity are readily available and can also be applied to models, since models (schema or instance) can automatically be transformed into a programming language (Hartmann, von Both 2010) or an instance structure. These metrics can therefore be helpful in the discussion about model complexity. Different approaches have been taken to handling model complexity and the complex process of modelling itself. Leal S. et al. (2014) develop a template-based model generating tool for energy simulation models to evade the lossy and complex recourse to IFC or gbXML models. Cao J. et al. (2014) use a transformation tool to generate building energy performance simulation models in order to reduce the complexity otherwise encountered in traditional building simulation programs. Thomas D. et al (2014) combine a CitySim model holding a simplified representation of the surrounding buildings with models for the EnergyPlus building performance engine. This allows for rapid assessment of the performance of the early design-stage building information models (BIM) on both the building and urban systems scale. Koene F. et al. (2014) take the reductionist idea of model theory a step further by reducing a building to a simple model consisting of two thermal masses. The Building Lifecycle Management Department at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology KIT conducts analyses beyond the scope of a single building. Analyses often have to take the urban environment into account, meaning that not only building models but also models of the surrounding city area are potentially involved. From the modelling standpoint this raises the question as to whether the city model and building models should be unified into one "super model", or whether models should be kept separate and the relations between them expressed by means of meta data. The work presented is a result of the research project "A model-driven approach to the integration of product models into cross-domain analysis processes" (original title: "Ein modellgetriebener Ansatz zur Integration von Produktmodellen in dom{\"{a}}nen{\"{u}}bergreifende Analyseprozesse") sponsored by the federal German research funding organization 'Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)'. {\textcopyright} 2015 The authors.},

This paper presents the development of a Modelica library for Building Information Modeling (BIM)-based building energy simulation (ModelicaBIM library) using an Object-Oriented Physical Modeling (OOPM) approach and Modelica, an equation-based OOPM language. By using the ModelicaBIM library, our project investigates system interfaces between BIM and energy simulation, which can perform semi-automatic translation from the building models in BIM to building energy modeling (BEM) using a BIM's authoring tool's Application Programming Interface (API). The ModelicaBIM library consists of OOPM-based BIM classes and OOPM-based BIM structure. OOPM-based BIM classes represent building component information. OOPM-based BIM structure consists of test case models that demonstrate (i) how building information in BIM can be transformed to OOPM and (ii) how design operations in BIM, such as changing a building geometry and editing building components, can be translated into BEM. A case study for simulation result comparisons has been conducted using (i) OOPM-based BIM models in the ModelicaBIM library and (ii) LBNL Modelica Buildings library (a Modelica-based building thermal simulation library developed by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory). Our implementation shows that the ModelicaBIM library enables (i) objects in BIM to be translated into the OOPM-based energy models and (ii) existing OOPM library to be utilized as a simulation solver for BIM-based energy simulation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Accordingly, the development of new applicable techniques is required that can support the information of detailed items in certification more efficiently to vitalize green buildings based on green building standards. From this perspective, this study seeks to propose a practical method to support the design of green buildings using a GBT, BIM-based green template, and to develop the supportive and evaluative environment for the demands of green building standards via GBT.
Driven by governments, all countries are enacting laws related to environmental improvements and establishing policies to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG). Because 26.9{\%} of the reduction plans from a total of 30{\%} of national GHG reduction targets is set in the building area, most countries are inducing green building expansion through the implementation of green building standards that reflect the countries' standards to achieve the 2020 target. To construct buildings that conform to the certification by satisfying the eco-friendliness of buildings, studies that consider this requirement should be performed from the initial design stage. However, there are several complicated work processes and problems in analysing items in detail, recognizing demand related to data, and applying data to work. {\textcopyright} 2015, Architectural Institute of Japan.

abstract = {This study aims to evaluate the extent to which building material specification affects life cycle environmental performance, using a building information modelling (BIM)-enhanced life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. A combination of the BIM-based design and analysis tool Revit Architecture, the energy simulation tool Green Building Studio (GBS) and the LCA tool ATHENA Impact Estimator were used for the assessment. The LCA was carried out on a life case study of a 2100 m2 two-floor primary-school building, as well as a variability analysis, by varying the material specification in terms of whole building materials. The life cycle performance of the buildings was primarily evaluated in terms of its global warming potential (GWP) and health impact. The findings of the study show that irrespective of the materials used, buildings that are based on renewable energy perform better than those based on fossil fuels over their life cycle. In terms of building materials, both environmental and health preferences of buildings congruently range from timber, brick/block and steel to insulated concrete formwork (ICF), in descending order. The study suggests that as buildings become more energy efficient during operational stages, serious attention needs to be given to their embodied impact. The study lays out a methodological framework that could be adopted by industry practitioners in evaluating life cycle environmental impact of different BIM-modelled material options at the building conception stage. This has the tendency to ensure that the highest proportion of life cycle environmentally beneficial material combinations are selected during specification and construction. {\textcopyright} 2015, {\textcopyright} 2015 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {The exponential growth of cities in India due to urbanization resulted in increased use of non-renewable energy resources to meet the essential power requirements of urban built environment. It is essential for urban planners to provide innovative solutions in context of urban energy simulation based on virtual 3D city models. The recent 3D geoinformation science studies are insufficient in providing optimal solutions because of lack of emerging concepts and integrated softwares. Presently 3D GIS data can be generated into various LODs (Levels of Detail) depending upon the application requirement and input data used. There are various 3D GIS softwares like Google SketchUp, ESRI CityEngine etc., which are being used mostly for data creation especially for boundary representation for geometry abstraction without semantic information. The 3D GIS data conversion from native format into City Geography Markup Language (CityGML) enhances it by providing information both at geometric and at semantic level in interoperable format. A building information model of Geoinformatics department building in IIRS campus is created using Google SketchUp and exported to energy modelling program in gbXML schema. The present investigation explores the semantic characteristics of developed CityGML model for solar thermal and photovoltaic energy production potential assessment based on building semantic components. The amount of solar irradiation incident on bounding features and also illumination obtained through openings of building is quantized using SunCast and RadianceIES application of IESVE Software, respectively. The simulated energy data are integrated with building semantic features and stored in open-source PostGIS RDBMS to address basic semantic queries. {\textcopyright} 2015 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {Building information modelling (BIM) provides architectural 3D visualization and a standardized way to share and exchange building information. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in using BIM, not only for design and construction, but also the post-construction management of the built facility. With the emergence of smart built environment (SBE) technology, which embeds most spaces with smart objects to enhance the building's efficiency, security and comfort of its occupants, there is a need to understand and address the challenges BIM faces in the design, construction and management of future smart buildings. In this paper, we investigate how BIM can contribute to the development of SBE. Since BIM is designed to host information of the building throughout its life cycle, our investigation has covered phases from architecture design to facility management. Firstly, we extend BIM for the design phase to provide material/device profiling and the information exchange interface for various smart objects. Next, we propose a three-layer verification framework to assist BIM users in identifying possible defects in their SBE design. For the post-construction phase, we have designed a facility management tool to provide advanced energy management of smart grid-connected SBEs, where smart objects, as well as distributed energy resources (DERs) are deployed. {\textcopyright} 2015 by the authors.},

The goal of this research was to develop guidelines for evaluation and selection of BEM tools to be used in particular building lifecycle phases. The objectives of this research were to: (1) Evaluate existing BEM tools; (2) Illustrate the application of the three BEM tools; (3) Re-evaluate the three BEM tools; and (4) Develop guidelines for evaluation, selection and application of BEM tools in the design, construction and operation/maintenance phases of buildings. Twelve BEM tools were initially evaluated using four criteria: interoperability, usability, available inputs, and available outputs. Each of the top three BEM tools selected based on this initial evaluation was used in a case study to simulate and evaluate energy usage, daylighting performance, and natural ventilation for two academic buildings (LEED-certified and non-LEED-certified). The results of the case study were used to re-evaluate the three BEM tools using the initial criteria with addition of the two new criteria (speed and accuracy), and to develop guidelines for evaluating and selecting BEM tools to analyze building energy performance. The major contribution of this research is the development of these guidelines that can help potential BEM users to identify the most appropriate BEM tool for application in particular building lifecycle phases. {\textcopyright} 2015 by the authors.},

Therefore, an optimization approach based on segmenting external facades and roofs into independent objects in a building information model was developed. A Genetic Algorithm is coupled with Industry Foundation Classes, an Energy Simulation software tool and a Life Cycle Cost estimation model to achieve an optimal allocation of energy saving elements to buildings' external envelopes, the use of which allows for a positive return on additional investment in energy saving elements.

abstract = {The ability to import building geometric and construction thermal data from building information models (BIM) has significant potential to reduce the time and uncertainty in building energy modeling process. In today's BIM-based energy modeling practice, thermal properties are mainly derived from generic building construction types in BIM. However, for energy modeling of existing buildings, such assumptions are often inaccurate as they do not account for diminishing thermal resistances of building materials instigated by their deteriorations. To improve the reliability of BIM-based energy modeling, we present a system, together with new methods for automated association and updating of actual thermal property measurements with BIM elements in gbXML schema. By leveraging collections of digital and thermal images and based on environmental measurements, our system first produces a 3D thermal model for the building under inspection and then derives the actual thermal resistances of the building assemblies at the level of 3D vertexes. By associating these measurements with their corresponding elements in gbXML, thermal properties of the BIM elements are automatically updated. Our experiments in real-world residential and instructional buildings show how actual thermal properties can be automatically associated with BIM elements and updated in gbXML. The proposed method shortens the gap between architectural information in BIM and the actual data needed for energy performance simulation, and enables reliable BIM-based energy analysis for retro-commissioning, continuous commissioning, and retrofit. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Of the several approaches taken to assess emissions, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) based methods do not just take into account the construction phase, but consider all phases of the life cycle of the construction. However, many current LCA approaches make general assumptions regarding location and effects, which do not do justice to the inherent dynamics of normal construction projects. This study presents a model to assess the embodied energy and associated GHG emissions, which is specifically adapted to address the dynamics of infrastructure construction projects. The use of the model is demonstrated on the superstructure of a prefabricated bridge. The findings indicate that Building Information Models/Modeling (BIM) and Discrete Event Simulation (DES) can be used to efficiently generate project-specific data, which is needed for estimating the embodied energy and associated GHG emissions in construction settings.

Handling of uncertainty by means of fuzzy logic and probabilistic modelling is analysed in light of MCDM. A sensitivity analysis of MCDM problems with uncertainties is discussed. An application of stochastic MCDM methods to a design of safety critical objects of civil engineering is considered. Prospects of using MCDM under uncertainty in developing areas of civil engineering are discussed in brief. These areas are design of sustainable and energy efficient buildings, building information modelling, and assurance of security and safety of built property. It is stated that before long the decision-making in civil engineering may face several methodological problems: the need to combine fuzzy and probabilistic representations of uncertainties in one decision-making matrix, the necessity to extend a global sensitivity analysis to all input elements of a MCDM problem with uncertainties, and an application of MCDM methods in the areas of civil engineering where decision-making under uncertainty is presently not common. {\textcopyright} 2015 Jurgita Antucheviciene et al.},

Several methods are also introduced to facilitate the diagnostics and measurement of the thermal and other environmental conditions. To this end, this paper extensively reviews the state-of-the-art techniques that can semi-automatically or automatically create as-is geometrical and thermal models for building energy modeling and retrofit assessment purposes. It also provides an overview on the main algorithms used by these methods for representing spatio-thermal point clouds, automatically converting these point clouds into semantic Building Information Models (BIM) in gbXML format for as-is energy modeling purposes, and also contrasting them with expected energy performance models. The underlying formulations and methods for measuring actual thermal resistance of the building assemblies and mapping them into gbXML-based representations are also presented.

abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to provide a unique conceptual framework for integrated asset management strategy that includes making use of available facility assessment methods and tools such as BREEAM In-Use, and Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED); and highlights proposes areas of commonality between these and the use of as-built Building Information Modelling, that ultimately becomes the Asset Information Model (AIM). This framework will consider the emerging requirements for the capture of Building Performance Attribute Data (BPAD), and how these can be managed in order to assist with effective post-construction building performance evaluation. Design/methodology/approach – A review of the current process relevant to the development of as-built BIMs and AIMs was undertaken which included a discussion of BIM standards and of the COBie process. This was combined with data provided by industry practitioners. This led to the concept of BPADs being developed, to be used within existing green building tool, BREEAM In-Use, COBIE and FM/Asset management methods. In turn these methodologies were used to identify possible synergies and areas of integration in AIM-enabled environments. Findings – Recognising the cyclical nature of asset management and BIM, a conceptual model was generated. It was found that BPADs could be aggregated within an AIM model which could influence the delivery of effective facilities and asset management. The model considers the use of existing Building Management Systems (BMS) and Computer Aided Facility Management Systems (CAFMs) and identifies issues associated with the overall sustainability strategy. Originality/value – A conceptual framework is generated that proposes the use of effective information management and aggregation of BPAD within an AIM. {\textcopyright}Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {Current practice utilizes two-dimensional (2D) drawings as the main visualization means to guide assembly. As an emerging technology, augmented reality (AR) integrates three-dimensional (3D) images of virtual objects into a real-world workspace. The insertion of digitalized information into the real-world workspace using AR can provide workers with the means to implement correct assembly procedures with improved accuracy and reduced errors. The limited available research concerning the applications of AR visualization means in assembly highlights the need for a structured methodology of addressing cognitive and usability issues for the application potentials of AR technology to be fully realized. Thus, the focus of the study presented in this paper is to investigate how much improvement in assembly productivity and performance can be achieved by lowering cognitive workload via AR. The AR system was developed in collaboration with Woodside Energy Ltd. following research project ECHO. Evaluation of the prototyped construction piping scenario revealed that the AR visualization yielded shorter task completion time (50{\%} reduction), fewer assembly errors (50{\%} reduction), and lower total task load. More specific findings also indicated that the animated AR visualization significantly shortened the original time (55{\%} reduction) and rework time (46{\%} reduction), payment to assemblers (50{\%} reduction), and cost of correcting erroneous assembly (66{\%} reduction). Questionnaire feedback revealed that the animated AR visualization better aided assembly comprehension and better facilitated information retrieval and collaboration between human and guidance medium. From a technology innovation perspective, by providing a higher level of immersion and interaction with spatial awareness, the dynamic AR guidance can be integrated with building information model (BIM) technology in helping and training practitioners, because all of the models and assembly sequences are designed in BIM and visualized in AR. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract = {When reconfigured into a cohesive system, a series of existing digital technologies may facilitate disassembly, take back and reuse of structural steel components, thereby improving resource efficiency and opening up new business paradigms. The paper examines whether Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology coupled with Building Information Modelling (BIM) may enable components and/or assemblies to be tracked and imported into virtual models for new buildings at the design stage. The addition of stress sensors to components, which provides the capability of quantifying the stress properties of steel over its working life, may also support best practice reuse of resources. The potential to improve resource efficiency in many areas of production and consumption, emerging from a novel combination of such technologies, is highlighted using a theoretical case study scenario. In addition, a case analysis of the demolition/deconstruction of a former industrial building is conducted to illustrate potential savings in energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions (GGE) from reuse when compared with recycling. The paper outlines the reasoning behind the combination of the discussed technologies and alludes to some possible applications and new business models. For example, a company that currently manufactures and 'sells' steel, or a third party, could find new business opportunities by becoming a 'reseller' of reused steel and providing a 'steel service'. This could be facilitated by its ownership of the database that enables it to know the whereabouts of the steel and to be able to warrant its properties and appropriateness for reuse in certain applications. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Recent research has been examining current challenges posed by our housing stock and exploring potential solutions from a range of perspectives. The aim of this paper is to discuss key findings from recent built environment research in Australia to initiate cross-sectorial discussion and debate about the implications and opportunities for other sectors such as emergency management and insurance. Three recent building research projects are discussed: Heat waves: The impact of heat waves on houses and occupants, and proposed changes to building regulations, air conditioning standards and building design, to reduce risks associated with heat waves. Net zero energy homes: Exploration of the potential benefits of a strategic optimization of building quality, energy and water efficiency, and household or community level distributed energy and water services for disaster management and recovery. Building information: Mapping of the flow of information about residential buildings, and the potential for national or regional building files (in a similar manner to personal medical records) to assist all parties to make more informed decisions that impact on housing sustainability and community resilience. The paper discusses how sustainability, environmental performance and resilience are inter-related, and can be supported by building files. It concludes with a call for increased cross-sectorial collaboration to explore opportunities for a whole-of-systems approach to our built environment that addresses a range of economic and environmental challenges as well as disaster and emergency management. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

In response to the global warming, the shortage of energy resources, and the challenges of environmental degradation, humans are trying to build low-carbon Eco-cities and to popularize low-carbon green buildings. Building “green”- refers to the entire life cycle of the building, which includes maximizing the conservation of resources (energy, water, land and materials), protecting the environment, reducing pollution, providing people with healthy, comfortable and efficient use of space, and establishing a harmony of nature and architecture. In the field of green and sustainable buildings, BIM can be integrated in analog-energy buildings, the air flow analysis and buildings' sunshine ecosystems. By using BIM it is possible to reduce waste and improve construction quality. BIM builds a “visualization” of the digital building models through a multi-dimensional digital design solutions, which provide the “simulation and analysis” of scientific collaboration platforms for designers, architects, utilities engineers, developers and even end users. Moreover, the BIM helps them to take advantage of three-dimensional digital models in design and construction of projects and operational management. {\textcopyright} 2015 The Authors},

abstract = {It is clear that the current industry process needs to improve in order to routinely deliver comfortable low-carbon buildings. Overheating in buildings designed to be of low energy is one of the key symptoms of current problems. Many initiatives aim to improve building performance and the industry process. A selection of these initiatives are reviewed including: the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive; the Green Star, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, Building Research Establishment's Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) and National Australian Building Environmental Rating Standards (NABERS) rating schemes; the Passivhaus standard; the Soft Landings process and Building Information Modelling (BIM). The BIM approach is being actively promoted based on the assertion that the building industry process has stagnated compared to other industries suggested as productivity benchmarks such as the electronics industry. This study highlights the potential role that could be played by BIM as a framework to address the performance gaps, and suggests that processes from the BIM benchmark industries should be investigated for potential adoption. The organizational context and processes of the electronics industry are described, and it is proposed that they could be usefully adapted to reduce the scale and impacts of the building industry performance gap. Key conclusions are that public domain performance data are important, and that the adoption of a quality systems approach will be required to deliver the intended performance in practice, eliminate overheating and avoid excess energy use. {\textcopyright} 2014 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {One of the significant ways to save energy use in buildings is to implement advanced energy retrofits in existing buildings. Improving energy performance of buildings through advanced energy retrofitting requires a clear understanding of the cost and energy implications of design alternatives from various engineering disciplines when different retrofit options are considered. The communication of retrofit design alternatives and their energy implications is essential in the decision-making process, as it affects the final retrofit selections and hence the energy efficiency of the retrofitted buildings. The objective of the research presented here was to identify a generic list of information requirements that are needed to be shared and collectively analyzed by integrated design teams during advanced energy retrofit design review meetings held in immersive settings. While identifying such requirements, the authors used an immersive environment based iterative requirements elicitation approach. The technology was used as a means to better identify the information requirements of integrated design teams to be analyzed as a group. This paper provides findings on information requirements of integrated design teams when evaluating retrofit options in immersive virtual environments. The information requirements were identified through interactions with sixteen experts in design and energy modeling domain, and validated with another group of participants consisting of six design experts who were experienced in integrated design processes. Industry practitioners can use the findings in deciding on what information to share with integrated design team members during design review meetings that utilize immersive virtual environments. {\textcopyright} 2015 by the authors.},

abstract = {BIM (Building Information Model) applications cover many areas such as quality control, monitoring, structural analysis and space management. BIM is also widely used as a basis for energy simulation as it contains most of the data needed for energy analysis. However, buildings feature multi-physics phenomena in which energy is only one aspect; therefore it is often needed to jointly perform different kinds of simulations and, to properly connect BIM to the related simulation environments and formats. In line with this concern, our research work focuses on the issue of heterogeneous multi-models interoperability for simulation. The aim is to devise an approach and to develop tools that can support and enhance connections between BIM authoring tools and simulation tools, covering various physical dimensions. To implement this approach, we propose to rely on some well-proven and focused standards from the Building Smart International consortium, namely the IDM (Information Delivery Manual) and the Model Views Definition (MVD). In this respect, this paper brings two contributions. The first is an in-depth review and discussion of the interoperability issues of the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) area, in particular since the advent of BIM technologies. The second is an account of the first results of our research work, focusing on the definition and implementation of a well-structured and standards-compliant approach to the generation of energy simulation models from BIM IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) models. This work entailed defining a mapping between the building elements as defined in the targeted simulation engine (the simulation engine of the French thermal regulation), and the corresponding IFC elements and attributes. As the IFC do not cover all the required elements for energy simulation, further enrichment of the IFC – either through ad hoc extension or through connection to complementary data sources – was defined and implemented. {\textcopyright} europia Productions, 2015.},

abstract = {An efficient multiregion hybrid method of the finite element method (FEM) combined with the boundary integral method (FEM-BIM) is first proposed for the fast simulation of 2-D scattering from an arbitrary dielectric target above a "Pierson-Moskowitz" rough sea surface. In the implementation of the multiregion hybrid method, the entire model is divided into multiple computational regions depending on energy distribution of an incident wave. With mutual coupling between the target and the dominant region of the sea considered, FEM and BIM are respectively applied to study the target and the dominant region to exactly obtain electromagnetic fields and currents, which have powerful illuminated field and strong interaction with each other. Mutual coupling between different subordinate regions is approximately considered by field integral equations based on Kirchhoff approximation by which the approximate currents in subordinate regions can be obtained. Because FEM and BIM are only performed on the target and the dominant region of the sea, the number of unknowns and the time required in the new method are dramatically reduced than those in the traditional FEM-BIM, making the hybrid method more efficient in the simulation of the composite problem. {\textcopyright} 1980-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Gaps between intended and actual performance which impact on indoor environment, energy use and carbon emissions have been well documented and are nowhere more important than when they present in performance problems such as building overheating and consequent occupant discomfort and high energy running costs. Here, such gaps are explored through a review of relevant literature and related illustrative investigations. Key drivers of those performance gaps are identified and located in the stages of the building industry process. Three case studies, of one office and two houses, are provided, highlighting where faults arise and may or may not be effectively dealt with and the reasons why. These include faults at the Implementation, Validation and Operation stages and the paper concludes by summing up generic failings in the industry that lead into the following paper by the same authors that offers an approach and potentially effective solutions to reduce such performance gaps by correctly using a BIM approach to quality control in the construction industry. {\textcopyright} 2014 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {Numerical simulation studies are carried out for improvement of energy efficiency in a room by with different thermal insulating materials using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The study considered various building insulating materials (BIM's) such as: (a) Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) (b) Fiber Glass (Resin bonded (RB)-Glass wool) (c) Polyurethane Foam (PUF) and (d) Cement Plaster (CP) along with composite bricklayer combination. A multi-physical 3D model room of size 2.6 m × 2.6 m × 2.6 m is created to analyze the performance of different insulating materials using CFD simulations. The experimental data of 24 hr temperature cycle of the ambient air is used for the analysis of performance of thermal comfort inside the room with the incorporation of different thickness of the insulating materials. The thickness of insulation 0.03, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 m is applied on interior side of walls and roof of the building. The study performed with different grid sensitiveness for coarse, medium and fine meshes for the improvement in the accuracy of the results. The fine grid mesh analysis is chosen to carry the further studies to compare the insulated and non-insulated condition for the thermal behavior inside the room. The result shows that the thermal conductivity and heat capacity of insulated walls are very important to be taken into account for carrying out detailed thermal analysis of buildings. The studies are carried out using commercial CFD tool of ANSYS CFX 15.0. The results of comparison shows that it is possible to maintain needed thermal comfort conditions in the room while reducing the total energy consumptions at the same time by appropriate use of BIM's. {\textcopyright} (2015) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract = {Abstract Designing with building performance simulation feedback in the early design stage has existed since the early days of computational modeling. However, as a consequence of a fragmented building industry building performance simulations (BPSs) in the early design stage are closely related to who is creating and operating the BPS models. This paper critically reviews the different ways designers and analysts use BPS in the early design stage. One of the key findings is that most tools and methods used in the early design stages are insufficient to provide valid feedback while in the same time being flexible enough to accommodate a rapid changing design process. The main concern points to the way geometrical models and analytical models are combined and how this affects the way the buildings are designed and perform. This paper concludes that integrated dynamic models may combine a design tool, a visual programming language and a BPS to provide better support for the designer during the early stages of design as opposed to alternatives such as the current implementation of IFC or gbXML or the unaccompanied use of simulation packages. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, many sensor network-based systems cognizing radios, resources, environments, and so forth are not practically feasible and useful for the elderly themselves. Therefore, this paper tries to propose novel research directions for designing smart residential environment for the elderly in terms of converging information technologies including cognitive sensor networks and architectural design. In this paper, we clarify the definition of smart home from the literatures and briefly surveys cognitive sensor network-based systems for smart elderly housing. After that, this paper proposes research directions for cognitive wireless sensor networks not only for the elderly smart home services, but also for cooperating with architecture technologies. The proposed directions are to utilize cognitive radio technologies, to classify sensor network technologies according to the types of the elderly, to expand sensor networks services for the elderly housing to the wider area such as blocking unnecessary energy loss, to embed sensor network modules into BIM system, and to research sensor networks fit to modular construction. {\textcopyright} 2015 Shinil Suh et al.},

Currently, decisions of design options and their technical measures are mainly reduced to an instantaneously assessed criterion (i.e. energy efficiency) within the sustainability assessment of buildings. Due to criteria interdependency, the current linear applied approach used in building certification neglects criteria trade-offs and is therefore only partly suitable for holistic building improvement processes. In order to fulfil stakeholder interests on the one hand and a high sustainability performance on the other, it is crucial to identify appropriate design measures. Based on the Austrian building certification system {\"{O}}GNI/DGNB, we applied a systemic approach for building sustainability-improvement, using a case study of a public office building in Graz, Austria. The main part of the study describes the important steps required for the systemic optimization of building sustainability. The method applied in this study allows the quantification of the relative influence and the identification of the individual optimization potential of design options on each single assessment criterion. The proposed systemic approach clearly demonstrated the improvement potential of the currently most developed building certification system considering the interdependency between the individual criteria.},

abstract = {Mining relationships between microbes and the environment they live in are crucial to understand the intrinsic mechanisms that govern cycles of carbon, nitrogen and energy in a microbial community. Building upon next-generation sequencing technology, the selective capture of 16S rRNA genes has enabled the study of co-occurrence patterns of microbial species from the viewpoint of complex networks, yielding successful descriptions of phenomena exhibited in a microbial community. However, since the effects of such environmental factors as temperature or soil conditions on microbes are complex, reliance on the analysis of co-occurrence networks alone cannot elucidate such complicated effects underlying microbial communities. In this study, we apply a statistical method, which is called Boolean implications for metagenomic studies (BIMS) for extracting Boolean implications (IF-THEN relationships) to capture the effects of environmental factors on microbial species based on 16S rRNA sequencing data. We first demonstrate the power and effectiveness of BIMS through comprehensive simulation studies and then apply it to a 16S rRNA sequencing dataset of real marine microbes. Based on a total of 6,514 pairwise relationships identified at a low false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.01, we construct a Boolean implication network between operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and environmental factors. Relationships in this network are supported by literature, and, most importantly, they bring biological insights into the effects of environmental factors on microbes. We next apply BIMS to detect three-way relationships and show the possibility of using this strategy to explain more complex relationships within a microbial community. {\textcopyright} 2014, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.},

abstract = {It is commonly known that the energy consumption of buildings is quite high; therefore, owners, architects, and engineers should be more concerned about the sustainability and energy performance of proposed building projects. For years, energy analysis tools have been used by designers to design energyefficient buildings. Generally, the energy analysis for this type of facilities is mostly conducted at the end of the design stage, once their components and elements have already been selected. However, analyzing the energy consumption of those components at the conceptual design stage is very helpful for designers when making decisions related to the selection of the most suitable design alternative that will lead to an energy-efficient building. Building Information Modeling (BIM) has the capability to help users assess different design alternatives and select vital energy strategies and systems at the conceptual design stage of proposed projects. Furthermore, by using BIM tools, designers are able to select the right type of materials early during the design stage and to make energy-related decisions that have great impact on the whole building life cycle. The main objective of this paper is to propose an integrated methodology that links BIM and energy analysis tools with green building certification systems. This methodology will be applied at the early design stage of a project's life. It will help designers measure and identify potential loss or gain of energy for different design alternatives and calculate the potential LEED points they may accumulate and gain and accordingly select the best one. An actual building project will be used to illustrate the workability and capability of the proposed methodology. {\textcopyright} 2014 The authors.},

In the architecture, engineering and construction sector, cloud-BIM integration is considered to be the second generation of building information management (BIM) development, and is expected to produce another wave of change across the construction industry. Despite this, few studies to date have attempted to summarise the research literature on cloud-BIM. This paper explores the literature to identify the substantive work on cloud-BIM, particularly regarding building life cycle management, to provide valuable insight for practitioners and to propose avenues for further research. Thirty academic sources, including refereed journal articles and conference papers, were retrieved and analysed in terms of their research focus and nature of application. The review revealed that most cloud-BIM research has focused on the building planning/design and construction stages. The findings suggest that more research should be directed towards operation, maintenance and facility management, energy efficiency and the demolition and deconstruction stages of building life cycle management. Further empirical research on organisational and legal issues, including security, responsibility, liability and model ownership, of the cloud-BIM model is also needed.COPYRIGHT: {\textcopyright} 2014 The authors.},

Previous studies with Fnip1-null mice revealed that Fnip1 is essential for pre-B-cell development. Here we report a critical role of Fnip1 in invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cell development. Thymic iNKT development in Fnip1-/- mice was arrested at stage 2 (NK1.1-CD44+) but development of CD4, CD8,.d T-cell, and NK cell lineages proceeded normally. Enforced expression of a Va14Ja18 iNKT TCR transgene or loss of the proapoptotic protein Bim did not rescue iNKT cell maturation in Fnip1-/- mice. Whereas most known essential transcription factors for iNKT cell development were represented normally, Fnip1-/- iNKT cells failed to down-regulate Promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger compared with their WT counterparts. Moreover, Fnip1-/- iNKT cells contained hyperactive mTOR and reduced mitochondrial number despite lower ATP levels, resulting in increased sensitivity to apoptosis. These results indicate that Fnip1 is vital for iNKT cell development by maintaining metabolic homeostasis in response to metabolic stress.},

abstract = {This paper describes the methodology developed and the calculation steps used to evaluate the energy efficiency potential of office buildings. The methodology enables a detailed analysis of retrofit options for the building envelope and its energy supply system. Different simplification measures accelerate the data acquisition process for office building stock owners and allow a data handling according to the existing building information, thus enabling office building structures to be prompted to design typical building constructions. We implement solutions enabling both a time-saving accelerated data input for office buildings and the handling of incomplete data. An automated calculation of the most common refurbishment measures allows a comparison of up to 64 combinations of measures, the illustration of energy and CO2 savings, and an economic evaluation. The latter takes into account the time value of money, the uncertainty of future energy prices, and the possibility of delaying an investment. To this end, a net present value analysis and a real options analysis are implemented, enabling a comparison of retrofit alternatives with different initial and future cash flows both for buildings occupied by the investor (owner-occupier perspective) and for rented buildings (tenant perspective). Energy price scenarios as well as a Monte Carlo simulation account for the uncertainty in energy price trends. For a university building used as a test case, the simplified and time-saving data input methods were successfully tested and an automated evaluation of 64 typical retrofit combinations carried out. The results of the energy, ecological and economic efficiency evaluation shows that a generally preferred retrofit option cannot always be identified. Specifically, for the test case, the best-rated economic refurbishment possibility leads to the largest increase in final energy demand amongst all options considered, which points out the necessity of a multi-criteria evaluation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Metro transit systems have gained a lot of importance because of the large number of passengers depending on that vital mode of transportation. Most of metro transit systems contain subways which need to be efficiently ventilated in order to maintain health and comfort of passengers. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor the thermal comfort inside subways. Subways are large facilities that require an efficient and huge ventilation system. Monitoring thermal condition for the subway is an important issue because of the variations that may occur in different spaces within the subway. These variations may affect energy consumption and the level of thermal comfort for the passengers as well. This research presents an application that utilizes wireless sensor network (WSN) and building information modeling (BIM) in order to monitor thermal conditions within a subway. BIM-based model is used to visualize the readings of air temperature and humidity levels in the subway spaces. Whereas, WSN is used to measure air temperature and humidity at different spaces within the subway via a group of transmitter nodes attached with different sensors. A case study is presented in order to illustrate the capabilities of the system developed. Finally, conclusion and future recommendations to expand this research is presented. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Although energy-efficient building technologies are emerging, a key challenge is how to effectively maintain building energy performance over the evolving lifecycle of the building. Field experience shows that energy savings of 5-30{\%} are typically achievable simply by applying energy Fault Detection and Diagnostics (FDD) and correcting faults diagnosed in buildings. Model-based FDD in buildings is a challenging task, not only because the task itself is difficult, but also because the workflow and information exchange behind the task is very complex and error prone. This complexity arises from several aspects. Firstly, creating a baseline building energy performance model suitable for FDD is both time and labor consuming. Secondly, the FDD module typically has its own ad-hoc platform, and the integration of this platform with the existing Building Energy Management System (BEMS) is technically challenging due to the incompatible interoperability. Finally, the information exchange itself is complex due to the existence of multiple functioning modules to make FDD workflow happen. To perform an efficient and effective FDD with the BEMS in buildings, information is needed to flow among an as-built building static information module, a building energy performance simulation module, a building operational data acquisition module and a FDD module. In such a complex process, it is challenging to ensure the information integrity and consistence. In this paper, we propose a Building Information Modeling (BIM) enabled information infrastructure for FDD, which streamlines the information exchange process and therefore has the potential to improve the efficiency of similar works in practice. The proposed information infrastructure was deployed and implemented in a real building for a FDD case study.},

abstract = {Green building design has been a major trend in the last decade which has largely affected the AEC industry. As of 2013, for example, there were over 13,000 green buildings certified with LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environment Design) in the United States alone. Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology and computer simulations are adopted largely for green building design. However, while information sharing and automated, collaborative design review are important for the design of green buildings, the current way of BIM-based green building design relies mainly on individual file transfer and does not support collaboration in the distributed environment of construction projects. On the other hand, as the Internet becomes ubiquitous, the web provides convenient and cost-efficient means for multi-location cross-organizational collaboration. Energy analysis and validation against standard building codes are two major processes in green building design evaluation. This paper presents a modular web service based framework which integrates the information necessary for green building design, automates the building design evaluation processes, and facilitates simple updates on the building model on a common but distributed platform. This framework is based on BIM data models like gbXML (Green Building XML) which contain information for green building design like geometry of the building, material, and sensor information from more than one source. The BIM data models act as a single source of building information for all processes. Building design evaluation and updating are iterative in green building design and require information and inputs dispersed among various project participants. Since our framework follows a distributed architecture and is easily accessible from the Internet, it makes the information required to facilitate the iterative process and its results conveniently available to a multi-participant environment. The paper also presents an example scenario demonstrating the developed framework. {\textcopyright} 2014 The authors.},

abstract = {BIM (building information model) enables information sharing and reuse for interoperability between prevalent software tools in the AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) industry. Although a BIM based energy simulation tool can reduce costs and time required for building energy simulation work, no practical interface between CAD tools and dynamic energy analysis tools has been developed so far. With this in mind, this study suggests two approaches (Full automated interface (FAI) and semi automated interface (SAI)) enabling information transition from CAD tools (e.g., IFC) to EnergyPlus input file, IDF. FAI, if ideally developed, can convert IFC to IDF based on the use of pre-defined defaults without requiring human intervention. In contrast, SAI converts geometry information drawn from IFC to IDF and then require human data entry for uncertain simulation inputs. For this study, a library building was chosen and space boundary generated from ArchiCAD 13 was employed for geometry mapping. The Morris method, one of sensitivity analysis methods, was used for identifying significant inputs. In FAI and SAI, dominant inputs, out of the Morris method, were identified for Monte Carlo simulation to quantify probabilistic simulation outputs. In the paper, FAI and SAI simulation results are cross-compared, and pros and cons of FAI and SAI are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Sustainable building rating systems are being increasingly adopted to assess the sustainability performance of building design and construction. Building information modelling (BIM)-based technologies are regarded as a potentially useful vehicle for helping project stakeholders to capture complete design and project information, and to make the best use of the available design data for sustainable design and sustainability rating analysis. While experience from the Leadership in Environmental Energy and Design (LEED) programme in the US has demonstrated the great potential of integrating BIM with building assessments, it is anticipated that BIM can also be effectively integrated with the Hong Kong 'BEAM Plus' sustainable building rating system. This study uses a two-stage method (i.e. a Delphi study and a case study) to explore the potential use of BIM in the case of a residential building project seeking BEAM Plus sustainable building certification in Hong Kong. The Delphi study indicated that 26 out of 80 credit points could potentially be achieved with the support of the documentation produced by BIM (i.e. Autodesk Revit). Detailed procedures for conducting and testing a BIM-based BEAM Plus sustainability analysis are described. The proposed BIM-BEAM Plus assessment framework is then verified using two sampled public housing modular flat models. The complexity of the BIM-BEAM Plus application depends on the project size, the extent of the model development detail and the nature of the project. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

The BIM project execution planning guidelines (PEPG) is widely adopted today to offer general guidance and standardized workflow of strategic BIM implementation. PEPG is not meant to and lacks the specificity to address green building projects in particular. However, the popularity of PEPG is conceived as an opportunity for this research to inherit its framework and create a special case of its implementation in green building projects. Considering the prevalence of leadership in energy and environmental design (LEED) green building rating system in global green building industry, this research is further refined to focus on LEED projects as an exemplary use case. Two major activities conducted include: (1) a comprehensive literature review of existing green BIM strategies and best practices; and (2) the proposition of an integrated green BIM process map (IGBPM), which is essentially adapting and further developing relevant process maps from PEPG and initiatives such as the architecture, engineering, construction, owner and operator, phase 1 (AECOO-1) joint testbed to address unique business processes of implementing BIM in LEED projects. The deliverables of this research include level 1 IGBPM and examples of level 2 IGBPM process maps, discussed along with case studies for verification and validation. The goal of this research is to create a prototype that facilitates holistic and systematic green BIM practices based upon clearly defined business processes and execution planning. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

The optical, thermal, and electrical properties of the proposed PV module are first evaluated, and then a wind-resistance test is carried out to evaluate the feasibility of installing it in Taiwan. The electrical and deflection characteristics of the proposed PV module did not change significantly after a 50 thermal cycling test and a 200-hour humidity-freeze test, based on IEC 61215 and a wind-resistance test. Finally, the electrical power generation ability of the proposed BIPV system with 1 kWp electrical power capacity was examined. Building information modeling software tools were used to simulate the BIPV system and carry out the energy analysis. The simulation results show a very consistent trend with regard to the actual monthly electricity production of the BIPV system designed in this work. The BIPV system was able to produce an accumulative electrical power of 185 kWh during the 6-month experimental period. In addition, the exterior temperature of the demonstration house was about 10°C lower than the surface of the BIPV system, which could reduce indoor temperature. {\textcopyright} 2014 Yen-Chieh Huang et al.},

For this task, the availability of as-built building models is of primary importance for both diagnosis of thermal dispersion and designing of retrofitting. In this paper, we present an automated methodology to derive highly detailed 3D vector models of existing building fa{\c{c}}ades starting from terrestrial laser scanning data. The presented methodology first accomplishes the segmentation of the point cloud of a building fa{\c{c}}ade into its planar elements. Then, starting from the identified planar clusters, fa{\c{c}}ade breaklines are automatically extracted to be used later to generate a 3D vector model. During this final step, some priors on urban scenes like the prevalence of straight lines and orthogonal intersections are exploited to set additional constraints. The final product is a semantically enriched 3D model of the building fa{\c{c}}ade that can be integrated in Building Information Model (BIM) for planned maintenance. Eventually, the integration between derived fa{\c{c}}ade models and infrared thermography (IRT) is presented for energy efficiency evaluation of buildings and detection of thermal anomalies. {\textcopyright} Societ{\`{a}} Italiana di Fotogrammetria e Topografia (SIFET) 2011.},

abstract = {Purpose: The construction industry has focused on operational and embodied energy of buildings as a way of becoming more sustainable, however, with more emphasis on the former. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the impact that embodied energy of construction materials can have on the decision making when designing buildings, and ultimately on the environment. This is an important aspect that has often been overlooked when calculating a building's carbon footprint; and its inclusion this approach presents a more holistic life cycle assessment. Design/methodology/approach: A building project was chosen that is currently being designed; the design team for the project have been tasked by the client to make the facility exemplary in terms of its sustainability. This building has a limited construction palette; therefore the embodied energy component can be accurately calculated. The authors of this paper are also part of the design team for the building so they have full access to Building Information Modelling (BIM) models and production information. An inventory of materials was obtained for the building and embodied energy coefficients applied to assess the key building components. The total operational energy was identified using benchmarking to produce a carbon footprint for the facility. Findings: The results indicate that while operational energy is more significant over the long term, the embodied energy of key materials should not be ignored, and is likely to be a bigger proportion of the total carbon in a low carbon building. The components with high embodied energy have also been identified. The design team have responded to this by altering the design to significantly reduce the embodied energy within these key components - and thus make the building far more sustainable in this regard. Research limitations/implications: It may be is a challenge to create components inventories for whole buildings or for refurbishments. However, a potential future approach for is application may be to use a BIM model to simplify this process by imbedding embodied energy inventories within the software, as part of the BIM menus. Originality/value: This case study identifies the importance of considering carbon use during the whole-life cycle of buildings, as well as highlighting the use of carbon offsetting. The paper presents an original approach to the research by using a "live" building as a case study with a focus on the embodied energy of each component of the scheme. The operational energy is also being calculated, the combined data are currently informing the design approach for the building. As part of the analysis, the building was modelled in BIM software. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

The UK government will be requiring fully-collaborative BIM in all public sector projects by 2016 and is also chasing the target of achieving zero-carbon buildings by 2019. This dual target will require the use of renewable energy analysis tools in the early stages of the building design process and establish the need for these tools to be IFC-compliant. This paper presents a conceptual framework for developing IFC-compliant renewable energy simulation tools using a multi-model concept in which the IFC data model provides partial input data required to run simulation models. A prototype has been developed as a 'proof-of-concept' for an IFC-compliant solar PV simulation tool. The prototype has been validated against other solar PV simulation tools such as PV*Sol, RETScreen{\textregistered} and HOMER to provide credibility to the simulation model. The developed conceptual framework is applicable not only to solar PV simulation but other renewable energy simulation models as well, thereby making an IFC-compliant renewable energy modelling tool capable of conducting, energy, carbon emissions and financial analysis. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Standardization is one of the pillars of interoperability. In this context, efforts promoted by the Open Geospatial Consortium, such as CityGML (Technical University, Berlin), a standard for exchanging three-dimensional models or urban city objects, are welcomed. However, information from other domains of interest (e.g. energy efficiency or building information modeling) is needed for tasks such as land planning, large-scale flooding analysis, or demand/supply energy simulations. CityGML allows extension in order to integrate information from other domains, but the development process is expensive because there is no way to perform it automatically. The discovery of correspondences between CityGML concepts and other domains concepts poses a significant challenge.Ontology matching is the research field emerged from the Semantic Web to address automatic ontology integration. Using the ontology underlying CityGML and the ontologies which model other domains of interest, ontology matching would be able to find the correspondences that would permit the integration in a more automatic manner than it is done now.In this paper, we evaluate if ontology matching techniques allow performing an automatic integration of geospatial information modeled from different viewpoints. In order to achieve this, an evaluation methodology was designed, and it was applied to the discovery of relationships between CityGML and ontologies coming from the building information modeling and Geospatial Semantic Web domains. The methodology and the results of the evaluation are presented. The best results have been achieved using string-based techniques, while matching systems give the worst precision and recall. Only in a few cases the values are over 50{\%}, which shows the limitations when these techniques are applied to ontologies with a partial overlap. {\textcopyright} 2013 {\textcopyright} Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {Thermal efficiency of building is a fundamental aspect in different countries to reach energy consumption reduction. However, even if a great attention is paid to build new "zero-energy" buildings,low attention is paid to retrofit existing ones. A fast analysis of existing buildings with Infrared Thermography (IRT) has proved to be an adequate and efficient technique. Indeed, IRT can be used to determine energy efficiency and to detect defects like thermal bridges and heat losses. However, both surface temperature and geometry are needed for a reliable evaluation of thermal efficiency, where spatial relationships are important to localize thermal defects and quantify the affected surfaces. For this reason, integration between Building Information Models (BIMs) and Infrared Thermography (IRT) can be a powerful tool to combine geometric information with thermal data in the same model. In this paper a methodology for automated generation of 3D model of buildings from laser data and integration with thermal images is presented. The developed methodology allows also fusion of thermal data acquired from different cameras and platforms. In particular, this paper will focus on thermal images acquired by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The proposed methodology is suitable for fast building inspections aimed at detecting the thermal anomalies in a construction. Its applicability was tested on different buildings demonstrating the performance of the procedure and its valid support in thermal surveys. {\textcopyright} Rinton Press.},

abstract = {The Bcl2 family of proteins is capable of switching the apoptotic machinery by directly controlling the release of apoptotic factors from the mitochondrial outer membrane. They have 'pro' and 'anti'-apoptotic subgroups of proteins which antagonize each other's function; however a detailed atomistic understanding of their mechanisms based on the dynamical events, particularly in the membrane, is lacking. Using molecular dynamics simulations totaling 1.6$\mu$s we outline the major differences between the conformational dynamics in water and in membrane. Using implicit models of solvent and membrane, the simulated results reveal a picture that is in agreement with the 'hit-and run' concept which states that BH3-only peptides displace the tail (which acts as a pseudo substrate of the protein itself) from its binding pocket; this helps the membrane association of the protein after which the BH3 peptide becomes free. From simulations, Bcl-xL appears to be auto-inhibited by its C-terminal tail that embeds into and covers the hydrophobic binding pocket. However the tail is unable to energetically compete with BH3-peptides in water. In contrast, in the membrane, neither the tail nor the BH3-peptides are stable in the binding pocket and appear to be easily dissociated off as the pocket expands in response to the hydrophobic environment. This renders the binding pocket large and open, thus receptive to interactions with other protein partners. Principal components of the motions are dramatically different in the aqueous and in the membrane environments and provide clues regarding the conformational transitions that Bcl-xL undergoes in the membrane, in agreement with the biochemical data. {\textcopyright} 2013 Maity et al.},

abstract = {In this study a Building Information Model (BIM) tool is developed to simultaneously estimate embodied and operational carbon over a 60 year life span for a typical four bedroom detached house. Using the tool, four different construction scenarios are evaluated, representing a range of current construction methods used in present day UK house building. The results show that cradle-to-gate embodied carbon represents 20-26{\%} of the total 60 year carbon emissions, with operational carbon representing 74-80{\%} of total emissions. Construction scenarios that reduce operational carbon by improving the thermal envelope led to a 1-13{\%} increase in embodied carbon but a 4-5{\%} decrease in operational carbon compared to the basecase construction method. Approaches to reduce embodied carbon in new-build housing are also studied and a 24{\%} reduction is demonstrated through building fabric changes. The study recommends that a universally robust methodology for measuring embodied carbon will enable design decisions to be taken to reduce whole life carbon emissions through improved choice of materials. Due to material changes impacting on the thermal characteristics of a dwelling, and to an extent the structural characteristics, an integrated BIM tool will be essential in quickly establishing whole life carbon impacts during the design stage. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Poly(phenylene oxide) (PPO) is firstly brominated followed by nucleophilic substitution reaction with methylbenzimidazole to obtain the objective BIm-PPO AEMs. Such solution-casting AEMs show good mechanical and thermal stabilities as well as the favorable fuel cell-related indicators, including high ion exchange capacity, proper water uptake and high ionic conductivity. In addition, a single H2/O2 fuel cell test by employing the optimal BIm-PPO-0.54 AEM yields a peak power density of 13mWcm-2 at 35°C, indicating the potential application of BIm-PPO AEMs in AFCs. Compared with the analogous AEMs based on PPO containing the classical pendant quaternary ammonium and imidazolium cations, BIm-PPO AEMs show the advantages in dimensional, mechanical and thermal stabilities, while simultaneously exhibiting the higher ionic conductivity. Compared with polybenzimidazolium based AEMs, where BIm cations distribute within the polymer backbone, AEMs herein present the higher ionic conductivity and power density (produced from a single cell test) due to the better mobility and aggregation abilities of pendant BIm cations attached to the backbone via a side chain relative to those distribute within the polymer backbone. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Buildings are designed to fulfil the multiple and, often, contradictory requirements of users, clients and society. Energy aspects are often not considered before the detailed design phase and a systematic way of analysing the energy performance of solutions throughout the design phase is lacking. A suggested framework, based on engineering design theories of requirements management, was applied to a case study of the design of an energy-efficient building in a real construction project. The case study provided qualitative insights into how the proposed framework can contribute to a more structured requirements management of a construction project with a focus on the energy-efficient design of buildings. It can be seen that the proposed framework for requirements management of energy performance provides a structure for designers to consider and apply energy performance criteria in the early design stages and visualize the consequences of alternative design solutions for clients, engineers, contractors and suppliers. The use of a requirements structure enables the transparency of different design alternatives against the established functional requirements of energy performance for the stakeholders in the design process. The use of BIM to support the proposed requirements framework needs to be studied further and connected to national and international construction classification schemas and ontology frameworks.

The rapid depletion of energy resources, has imparted researchers to focus on energy conservation and wastage. The next generation of smart buildings is becoming a trend to cope with the needs of energy and environmental ease in buildings. This advances the intelligent control of building to fulfill the occupants' need. Intelligent system control for sustainable buildings is dynamic and highly complex. Building information accuracy with an effective controller scheme is a challenging task. This paper presents the fuzzy control system architecture (FCSA) for resolving the conflict of maintaining the inhabitants comfort index and the energy consumption in buildings. It also infers the graphical relationship between energy consumption and comfort parameters. With a distributed fuzzy inference system (FIS), control has been developed for temperature, air quality and artificial lighting comfort parameters. Model simulation has been carried out and control factors have been discussed. The FIS models have also been validated with implication of change function. The presented control system is capable of achieving energy conservation in the buildings.},

It was suggested that early adoption of facilities management will contribute to reducing the needs for major repairs and alternations that will otherwise occur at the operational phase. There should be an integrated data source providing information support for the building lifecycle. It is envisaged that Building Information Modelling (BIM) would fill the gap by acting as a visual model and a database throughout the building lifecycle. This paper develops a framework of how FM can be considered in design stage through BIM. Based on the framework, the paper explores how BIM will beneficially support FM in the design phase, such as space planning and energy analysis. A case study of using BIM to design facility managers' travelling path in the maintenance process is presented.

abstract = {In this paper, we report a methodology, developed in the context of Smart Energy Efficient Middleware for Public Spaces European Project, aimed at exploiting ICT monitoring and control services to reduce energy usage and CO2 footprint in existing buildings. The approach does not require significant construction work as it is based on commercial-off-the-shelf devices and, where present, it exploits and integrates existing building management systems with new sensors and actuator networks. To make this possible, the proposed approach leverages upon the following main contributions: (a) to develop an integrated building automation and control system, (b) to implement a middleware for the energy-efficient buildings domain, (c) to provide a multi-dimensional building information modelling-based visualisation, and (d) to raise people's awareness about energy efficiency. The research approach adopted in the project started with the selection, as case studies, of representative test and reference rooms in modern and historical buildings chosen for having different requirements and constraints in term of sensing and control technologies. Then, according to the features of the selected rooms, the strategies to reduce the energy consumptions were defined, taking into account the potential savings related to lighting, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and other device loads (PC, printers, etc.). The strategies include both the control of building services and devices and the monitoring of environmental conditions and energy consumption. In the paper, the energy savings estimated through simulation, for both HVAC and lighting, are presented to highlight the potential of the designed system. After the implementation of the system in the demonstrator, results will be compared with the monitored data. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Current methods and programs for running energy simulations are not very timely, are difficult to understand, and lack high interoperability between BIM and energy simulation software. It is necessary to improve on these drawbacks as design decisions are often made without the aid of energy modeling leading to the design and construction of nonoptimized buildings with respect to energy efficiency. The goal of this research project is to develop a new methodology to produce energy estimates from a BIM model expeditiously and to improve interoperability between the simulation engine and BIM software. In the proposed methodology, the extracted information from a BIM model is compiled into an input file and run in a popular energy simulation program on an hourly basis for a desired period. The case applied in this paper showed that the application of this methodology can be used to quickly provide energy simulations from BIM models. With the aid of an easy-to-run and easily understood energy simulation methodology, designers will be able to make more energy conscious decisions during the design phase and as changes in design requirements arise. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

However, many barriers exist to their interoperability and there is little interaction between these islands of information. As part of moving building data to the cloud there is a critical need to reflect on the design of cloud-based data services and how they are designed from an interoperability perspective. If new cloud data services are designed in the same manner as traditional building management systems they will suffer from the data interoperability problems. Linked data technology leverages the existing open protocols and W3C standards of the Web architecture for sharing structured data on the web. In this paper we propose the use of linked data as an enabling technology for cloud-based building data services. The objective of linking building data in the cloud is to create an integrated well-connected graph of relevant information for managing a building.

abstract = {This research analyzed how hotel's marketing preference for certain guests from different world regions would influence their energy consumption and the revenue generated by them who travel and lodge in Taiwan. Energy consumption data, building information, and hotel operation data were collected from 49 Taiwanese international tourist hotels and 24 standard tourist hotels, which are equivalent to five and four-star hotels. The statistical results show that the energy use among hotels under surveyed ranges between 83 and 408 MJ/guest per night, and could create averaged revenue of US{\$}149 for each guest accommodated. To identify a hotel's primary marketing preference for accommodating certain region of guests, factors of certain regional guest ratios were employed. Multiple-regression model was established to characterize the hotel energy consumption via regional guest ratios. It indicates that the energy consumption varied with hotels' regional guest ratios. It also reveals that hotels with their marketing preference for accommodating guests from Europe and North America would have higher energy use characteristic followed by those aiming for guests from Australia, Asia (excluding Japan and China), Japan, domestic Taiwan, and China in descending order. Multiple regression models were used to investigate relationships between the yearly energy consumption and total revenue of hotels. The models established are statistically reliable and could be beneficial for hotel's marketing, room price fixing, or operating references. The study also reveals that guests from the well developed countries would generally create more revenue. However, additional expenses on energy will also incur for hotels whose marketing preference towards them, which may possibly exceed their profit. In profit-energy costs perspective, it is recommended that hotel targeted for guests from Japan might be the most beneficial in Taiwan. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The Ratio of Equivalent Transparency (Req) is a basic index for assessing whether a building is energy-efficient in Taiwan. Req is the ratio of the area of total building envelope and the area of envelope equivalent transparency. Calculation of Req requires not simply the consideration of natural factors such as building location, direction, ambient lighting and sunshine, but also and physical factors such as material, structure, ventilation and sunshade. Current practices in Taiwan of manually calculating Req render the results prone to error, and are also time-consuming. Therefore, this research developed a visual Req calculation tool based on a 3D environment. This system provides users with various visualization tools to view the status and Req results of the building project. Furthermore, object-oriented modeling and parametric design can shorten the time taken to look-up tables and simplify the process of Req calculation, and also help to reduce computation time and errors. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Purpose: Because of global environmental concerns, sustainable design has become a mainstream building design goal in recent years. Sustainable development is even more urgent in the light of global climate change. This paper aims to examine the contributions which building information modelling (BIM) can make to the production of sustainable building designs. Design/methodology/approach: Various research methodologies have been adopted, including literature review, design tool analysis, a case study and structured face-to-face interviews. Data collected were synthesized as part of the research process. Findings: BIM is found to be ideally suited to the delivery of information needed for improved design and building performance. Two most significant benefits of BIM for sustainable building design are: integrated project delivery (IPD) and design optimization. However, there are also barriers to adopting BIM for sustainable design. Research limitations/implications: This paper does not attempt to address all aspects of BIM functionality because the scope of BIM is very great and the resources of this research were limited. Practical implications: Successful implementation of BIM is able to eliminate the extra cost of design changes during the subsequent phases of construction process. BIM, therefore, is also capable of enhancing the project delivery culture in future. Social implications: BIM solutions can contribute to the selection of best solutions to reduce energy and resources consumption. This new technology and the approach also can generate the need of more innovative professionals and job opportunities. Originality/value: This paper investigates the contribution of BIM to sustainable buildings from the perspective of design performance and improved communication and coordination. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {The notion of advancing levels of adequate regulatory compliance within the domain of construction and engineering is by no means a new phenomenon. An extensive degree of effort has over a number of decades previously focused on semi/fully automating design checking against regulatory building codes. After experiencing somewhat of a dip in popularity within academia, this research topic is once again of great interest due to the on-going adoption of Building Information Modelling (BIM) within the construction domain among other drivers like frequent updates to building regulatory documents particularly in relation to sustainability related issues like energy efficiency of buildings. This interest will only increase as we witness further widespread adoption of this new BIM paradigm across until now untouched disciplines. Unfortunately design checking within the remit of BIM still faces major problems with respect to national and local regulations as no sustainably sensible or scalable method has yet been implemented to ensure compliance rules are consistent with current legislation within these contexts. This work questions a suitable representational data format for UK construction and engineering regulations focusing on machine processable formats built entirely on open data standards which can then set the basis for addressing the aforementioned issues. We compare two existing legislation data models, namely the Crown Legislation Markup Language (CLML) and Akoma Ntoso, whilst in the process grading each on its suitability for most accurately accommodating and expressing the domain and profession specific nature of typical building regulations. The study conclusions indicate that the design, management and current availability of the CLML has resulted in a scenario where barriers exist to widespread adoption, this includes building out community in support of the language. Akoma Ntoso on the other hand has focused on building community around the proposed standard. This increases the likelihood of phased organisational transition towards the standard for achieving improved representational data modelling. {\textcopyright} 2013 The authors.},

abstract = {Rehabilitation of the existing building stock is a key measure for reaching the proposed reduction in energy consumption and CO2 emissions in all countries. Building Information Models stand as an optimal solution for works management and decision-making assessment, due to their capacity to coordinate all the information needed for the diagnosis of the building and the planning of the rehabilitation works. If these models are generated from laser scanning point clouds automatically textured with thermographic and RGB images, their capacities are exponentially increased, since also their visualization and not only the consultation of their data increases the information available from the building. Since laser scanning, infrared thermography and photography are techniques that acquire information of the object as-is, the resulting BIM includes information on the real condition of the building in the moment of inspection, consequently helping to a more efficient planning of the rehabilitation works, enabling the repair of the most severe faults. This paper proposes a methodology for the automatic generation of textured as-built models, starting with data acquisition and continuing with geometric and thermographic data processing. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

However, such tools still have much room for improvement: manual input of thermal properties of a building material; input of incorrect data; and semantic conflicts between building designers and engineers. This research proposes a semantic material name matching system to find a standardized material name and its associated material property values, and enter them into a BEA tool. The core of our approach is to define ontologies capturing the concepts associated with the standard materials and their property values that are required by BEA tools. The proposed system uses an IFCXML file of a building information model as a source of input data, captures material data in the files, and automates the process of material property input. Using the proposed system, engineers will be able to increase their ef ficiency in entering required data into BEA tools and to reduce the possibility of erroneous data input. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Building Information Modeling (BIM) for optimizing the total lifecycle cost of buildings is a challenge even today. Inadequate software interoperability, high costs as a result of the fragmented nature of the building industry, lack of standardization, inconsistent technology adoption among stakeholders are just some of the obstacles that architects and engineers face. However, optimization requires a structured procedure that enables continuous changes in design variables and assessment on energy consumption. A holistic building design and construction are already introduced in Europe through the energy performance of buildings directive (EPBD). The requirements have been strengthened by the EPBD recast for achieving cost optimal building designs for the life cycle of the building, moving towards nearly zero energy buildings by the end of the decade. BIM and intelligent services could play a crucial role in these efforts with improved visualization and productivity due to easy retrieval of information, increased coordination of data and exchange of information, all leading to a reduced cost for the design of energy efficient buildings. An ongoing European research project aims to contribute to these needs by developing a Virtual Energy Laboratory that will support building energy performance simulations taking into account the stochastic nature of input parameters and processes. This will be supported by information communication technology features utilizing the necessary computational power through cloud computing. This paper presents an overview of the ongoing efforts and focuses on results for assessing the impact of different input weather and climate data that are pertinent in building load and energy performance calculations. {\textcopyright} Balaras et al.},

abstract = {Designs which address sustainability requirements are becoming increasingly desirable, as the objectives of sustainable design reduce resource depletion of energy, water, and raw materials; prevent environmental degradation caused throughout their lifecycle; provide safe, comfortable and healthy living environments. Currently, sustainability in the building domain is judged against standards codified in rating systems. That is, design choices are validated, by measuring design performance against criteria specified by the rating system. Advances in building technologies, design and evaluation tools, and government policies together with tools to benchmark sustainability have created the momentum which fuels an increasing trend towards sustainable building design. However, certification is expensive. It is labor intensive, involving large volumes of data aggregation and information accounting, which, despite the best of intentions, often become a deterrent to designers and the design process. Compliance with a sustainability rating system is not mandatory; increasingly, it is becoming a goal that many designers and authorities would like to achieve. In turn, this demands a cost lowering improvement to the certification process. Since designers mainly tend to employ commercial design tools, it becomes imperative to create a general approach that utilizes information already available in digital form and combine it with rating system information requirements. The challenge lies in identifying informational requirements from rating systems, representing them in computable forms, mapping them to information available from a commercial design tool and evaluating the performance of the design. In this paper we present an overall framework for organizing, managing, and representing sustainability information requirements; to demonstrate an approach to integrating sustainability evaluations in a design environment. We employ a commercially available building information modeler and a sustainable building rating system to develop a process that bridges sustainability assessment requirements with information from the model for pre-evaluation prior to submission for certification. This will enable designers, owners, contractors and other professionals to communicate strategies and make informed decisions to achieve sustainability goals for a project.},

Findings: The paper provides a quantitative calculation method for the carbon emissions of buildings, and suggests an approach to integrate the BIM techniques with the low carbon research. This allows the quantity of material consumption and carbon emission to be calculated in real time during the whole construction process. Research limitations/implications: Because of the chosen American database, the calculation results may lack generalizability. Therefore, the approach of establishing a universal database of carbon emission coefficients will be the next key point. Practical implications: As this research shows, there is a need for an advanced calculation method to evaluate the buildings' carbon emission exactly by BIM techniques, which also provides a basis to establish the regulation of carbon transaction tax in the future. Originality/value: This paper fulfils an identified need to calculate the carbon emission during the buildings' construction stage, so that better decisions can be made to optimize the construction plan and choose the low emission materials properly. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Realizing this potential requires tools that enable design of sophisticated genetic systems. The functional diversity of RNA makes it an attractive and versatile substrate for programming sensing, information processing, computation, and control functions. Recent advances in the design of synthetic RNA switches capable of detecting and responding to molecular and environmental signals enable dynamic modulation of gene expression through diverse mechanisms, including transcription, splicing, stability, RNA interference, and translation. Furthermore, implementation of these switches in genetic circuits highlights the potential for building synthetic cell systems targeted to applications in environmental remediation and next-generation therapeutics and diagnostics. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {Synergies between building information modelling (BIM) and Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) have been recognized early on, since the industry started embracing BIM. However, current practices of implementing BIM in LEED projects remain ad hoc, resulting in job-specific success difficult to replicate. As both BIM technology and LEED systems are making continuous improvement, it has become overwhelming for project teams to work out an optimal strategy to exploit their technology and management strength in LEED project delivery. This paper looks at a rising trend in recent BIM development, which is the cloud-deployed BIM server (cloud-BIM) technology, and proposes a new business paradigm so project teams can leverage cloud-BIM to achieve LEED Automation. The new paradigm overcomes the limitation in capacity and communication of conventional desktop computing and stand-alone BIM. It empowers the project team with scalable and concurrent collaboration that was essential to delivery high performance sustainable projects such as LEED projects. A framework that integrated strengths of cloud-BIM, various LEED dedicated SaaS (Software as a Service) solutions and open information exchange protocols is created to delineate possible implementation strategies for this new paradigm.

abstract = {Buildings represent long-term, capital-intensive investments designed to perform for decades into the future. Consequently, the potential for changes in climate across the design lifetime of built environments represents an immediate challenge for planning, design, and construction. In this study, we consider the opportunities to assess Climate Sensitivity and adaptive opportunities associated with green building practice. We developed a pair of complementary indicators called the Climate Sensitivity Index (CSI) and Climate Adaptation Opportunity Index (CAOI). These indicators are applied to evaluate individual strategies (" credits" ) within the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED™) for New Construction rating system. The indices provide two complementary scores for each strategy. The CSI reflects potential sensitivity to changing conditions (i.e., risks to performance outcomes), and the CAOI indicates potential adaptive opportunities (i.e., plausible strategies to adapt to changing conditions). We apply the indices to retrospectively examine the prevalence of potentially sensitive and adaptive practices among a global set of 2440 LEED-certified projects. Adaptive opportunities were more prevalent than sensitivities in the LEED-NC rating system. The CSI and CAOI indices illustrate how information can be derived by interpreting patterns of LEED credit achievement. The indices will be available within a suite of analytical tools in the Green Building Information Gateway (www.gbig.org). {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Proteins of the Bcl-2 family regulate apoptosis through the formation of heterodimers between antiapoptotic or pro-survival proteins and proapoptotic or pro-death proteins. Overexpression of antiapoptotic proteins not only contributes to the progression of many cancers, but also confers resistance to the chemo- and radiotherapeutic treatments. It has been demonstrated that peptides containing the BH3 domain of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members are able to bind and inhibit antiapoptotic proteins. For this reason, the design of small molecules mimicking the BH3 domain of proapoptotic proteins has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment during the last years. However, BH3 domains exhibit different affinities for binding to antiapoptotic proteins; whereas Bim(BH3) and Puma(BH3) are able to bind all antiapoptotic proteins, others like Bad(BH3) and Bmf(BH3) show preference for some proteins over others. Consequently, the ability of a BH3-mimetic to kill tumor cells will depend on the BH3 peptide used as template and thus will have a selective or pan-inhibition effect. Recently, it has been suggested that this last approach could be interesting. Therefore, the present work is aimed to elucidate how the nonselective peptide Bim(BH3) is able to bind to all of the Bcl-2 family antiapoptotic proteins. To unravel the molecular determinants of this pan-inhibition, we used the MM-PB/GBSA approaches to calculate the binding free energy of the different complexes studied and to determine which residues of the peptide have the largest contribution to complex formation. Results obtained in the present work show that the binding of Bim(BH3) to pro-survival proteins is mainly hydrophobic and that specific interactions are fully distributed along the peptide sequence. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed to investigate the effect of functionalized linkers on CO 2 binding in zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs). Three typical ZIFs with different functionalized linkers are considered: ZIF-68 with bIM linker (C 6H 6 group), ZIF-69 with cbIM linker (chlorine group), and ZIF-78 with nbIM linker (nitro group). Compared to bIM linker, the charge distributions of cbIM linker and nbIM linker have been significantly changed by the substitution of the functional groups and have been proved to have positive effects to enhance the binding capacity of CO 2. The withdrawal of electronic charge from the linker leads to enhanced acidity for the hydrogen atoms on linker, which can form weak hydrogen bond interactions with the oxygen atoms of CO 2. The binding capacity of nbIM linker for CO 2 is much higher than those of bIM and cbIM linkers for CO 2, which is due to the strong effect of nitro group on polarizing the CO 2 molecule and thus enhances the interaction force between them. The binding energies of CO 2 in the IM linkers are within the range of -1.64 to -18.54 kJ/mol, which suggests that the binding belongs to physisorption. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this study is to identify an objective energy performance assessment method in Korea, and to build a building information modelling (BIM) based system that can assess the energy performance of buildings. Design/methodology/approach - The energy performance assessment methods currently used in Korea were first identified via a literature review. A system was then implemented to solve the problem of objectivity. The system was implemented through a data-based building information model, instead of the existing method of documented two-dimensional (2D) CAD. In addition, Revit Architecture (a BIM tool), MS Access, and Visual Basic (VB) were used to implement the system. To verify the system's efficiency, it was compared to the existing method by applying both to an actual case (a school facility). Findings - This study found that the issue of subjectivity in the Korean energy performance assessment method may be resolved with a data-based BIM. Originality/value - This study presented the BIM-EPAS to reduce errors and the time needed to conduct an energy performance assessment. In order to follow a realistic approach, the BIM-EPAS was applied to an actual assessment case, thereby verifying the system's applicability.

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the performance of public-private partnership (PPP) and the ability of private consortia and public authorities to together develop solutions that reduce building energy consumptions. Design/methodology/approach: The paper reviews the performance of PPP projects based on criteria such as respect for timely delivery and costs, innovation, service quality and life cycle costing; then a case study focusing on energy saving performance contract (ESPC) is expounded. Findings: The research indicates that PPP performs well on issues such as respect of timetable and contracted prices but does not establish that PPP promotes innovation, quality of service delivery and life cycle costing. It also appears that energy issues are gradually integrated in contracts in progress under the influence of thermal regulations. Among PPP projects, ESPC focuses on energy savings measures. Their success mainly requires that public authorities have a good knowledge of the status, occupation level and energy consumptions of their buildings. Information disclosure in the contract also reduces uncertainty and creates trust among partners. Practical implications: The research should raise the awareness of public authorities on imperatives to have a good knowledge of the status, occupation level and energy consumptions of their buildings. Originality/value: Most PPPs have been evaluated at the design and construction stages. Evaluations of PPPs in operation are less frequent. Examining the first ESPC in operation in France is an original contribution that opens doors for further empirical investigations in this field. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Cooling degree days are calculated from differences between outdoor temperatures above the base temperature and the base temperature itself, therefore containing both climate and building information. The difficulties in applying this method are the determination of base temperature and choosing a procedure for calculating degree days, which vary depending on the resolution of the weather data used. In addition, the cooling degree method has a major flaw, i.e. it considers only a linear dependence between cooling energy consumption and sensible cooling load, thereby ignoring latent loads, which become more significant at higher outdoor temperatures. In this article an analysis of real electric energy consumption data using the cooling degree method and an improved method derived from it that includes latent loads, as well as a comparison between them, are shown. Both methods are applied several times to metered data, each time with a different combination of a method for determining base temperature and a degree day calculation technique. {\textcopyright} 2012 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.},

Traditional simplified design tools are typically too limited to be of much use, even in conceptual design. The proposal is to provide access to the power of detailed simulation tools at a stage in design when little is known about the final building, but at a stage also when the freedom to explore options is greatest and the ability to improve the design is greatest. The concept of the building performance sketch forms the basis of the proposed design tool. It was derived from consultation with design analysis teams as part of the development of the COMFEN tool for fenestration design. Tools like COMFEN are explored to understand how they were shaped by consultation and how requests from these teams for real-world relevance might shape such tools in the future. The simulation process can effectively utilize some of the as-built, as-occupied and as-managed lessons on behaviours and technical outcomes from the Post-occupancy Evaluation (PoE) of buildings. {\textcopyright} 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {One of the significant benefits of Building Information Modeling (BIM) is the ability to effectively use analysis and evaluation programs during design, as feedback. However, the current dominant approach to analysis and evaluation of design proposals requires the creation of a separate building model for each kind of evaluation. This typically involves using a BIM tool to prepare the data for a specific type of analysis to obtain design feedback. Most of the effort lies in modifying the building model to support the analysis required. When dealing with multiple evaluations, this process is time consuming, greatly reducing the design benefits of BIM. We propose a system architecture to facilitate analysis and feedback in architectural design, based on post-processing design-oriented building models. The post-processing automatically adapts the building model to the needs of the specific analysis, where multiple analyses can be run from the same building model. We outline the methods for realizing such design interoperability. By utilizing geometric and attribute relationships and semantics, data subsets are identified and aggregated. We present an example where the design of a class of buildings - federal courthouses, is evaluated in terms of multiple analyses: programmatic spaces, building circulation, energy consumption, and preliminary cost. These analyses are performed by post-processing a single BIM model. The method is applicable to both API-based direct interfaces as well as open-standard building models. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A case-study building, located on the campus of University College Cork, was used for the modelling and actual retrofit. This allowed for a comparison to be made between actual measured data and the proposed modelling techniques with regard to thermal energy modelling. The measured data along with the two types of modelled data, gave an extensive data set from which the assessment of the two modelling techniques could be made. This assessment proposes a modelling technique which is sufficient to base future retrofitting decisions upon. This research demonstrates clearly that fundamental building information, simplified occupancy profiles, simplified weather data and a less time consuming model is a sufficient and adequate means to base retrofitting decisions on. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Bcl-2 (B cell lymphoma-2) is an anti-apoptotic member of Bcl-2 family and its overexpression causes development of several types of cancer. The BH3 domain of pro-apoptotic and BH3-only proteins is capable of binding to Bcl-2 protein to induce apoptosis. This binding is the basis for the development of novel anticancer drug which would likely antagonize Bcl-2 overexpression. In this study we have identified BH3 domain of Bax (Bax BH3) as potentially the best Bcl-2 antagonist by performing docking of BH3 peptides (peptides representing BH3 domain of pro-apoptotic and BH3-only proteins) into the Bcl-2 hydrophobic groove formed by BH3, BH1 and BH2 domains (also referred as BH3 cleft). To predict the best small antagonist for Bcl-2, three groups of small peptides (pentapeptide, tetrapeptide and tripeptide) were designed and screened against Bcl-2 which revealed the structural importance of a set of residues playing a vital role in interaction with Bcl-2. The docking and scoring function identified KRIG and KRI as specific peptides among the screened small peptides responsible for Bcl-2 neutralization and would induce apoptosis. The applied pharmacokinetic and pharmacological filters to all small peptides signify that only IGD has drug-like properties and displayed good oral bioavailability. However, the obtained binding affinity of IGD to Bcl-2 was diminutive. Hence deprotonation, amidation, acetylation, benzoylation, benzylation, and addition of phenyl, deoxyglucose and glucose fragments were performed to increase the binding affinity and to prevent its rapid degradation. Benzoylated IGD tripeptide (IGD bzo) was observed to have increased binding affinity than IGD with acceptable pharmacokinetic filters. In addition, stability of Bcl-2/IGD bzo complex was validated by Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations revealing improved binding energy, salt bridges and strong interaction energies. This study suggests a new molecule that inhibits Bcl-2 associated cancer/tumor regression. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The architectural construction industry has become increasingly more specialized over the past 50 years, creating a culture of layer thinking over part-to-whole thinking. Building systems and technologies are often cobbled together in conflicting and uncorrelated ways, even when referred to as 'integrated', such as by way of building information modeling. True integration of building systems requires rethinking how systems and architectural morphologies can push and pull on one another, creating not only innovation in technology but in aesthetics. The revolution in composite materials, with unprecedented plasticity and performance features, opens up a huge range of possibilities for achieving this kind of convergence. Composites by nature fuse envelope and structure, but through various types of inflections, they can also be made to conduct air and fluids through cavities and de-laminations, as well as integrate lighting and energy systems. Assembly as we know it moves away from mineral materials and hardware and toward polymers and 'healing'. Further, when projected into the near-future realm of multi-materiality and 3D manufacturing, possibilities for embedding systems and creating gradients of rigidity and opacity open up, pointing to an entirely new realm of architectural thinking. {\textcopyright} 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

To take a further step towards zero emission buildings, it is necessary to identify what contributes the most to building energy use. Further, the idea was to encourage a smart use of BEMS data for energy use analysis. Multivariable analysis was used for the data analysis. Databases of 76 and 41 variables respectively, which included occupancy level, control signals, and water and air temperatures, were used to explain heating, electricity, and fan energy use. The results showed that important variables were different for different months in the case of heating energy use. The total electricity and fan electricity use could be defined with the same variables in different months. The total electricity use could be defined by using occupancy level and input fan signals. The suggested approach could be used by building operators to identify opportunities for decreasing energy use and for energy use estimation when data are lost due to data transmission issues or other problems. A relationship between building information and energy use was established. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The building information modeling (BIM) is a new tool used by the architecture, engineering and construction industry to design and build new buildings. Similar to manufacturing companies, architects and engineers are using digital prototypes in building design. As the building industry is taking interest in environmental concerns, sustainable design has emerged as a growing field. Keeping sustainability in mind, it is desirable that environmental performance indicators also be involved while finalizing the designs. This could be accomplished by adding additional parameters such as embodied energy, reusability, deconstructability, and recycled content to the material data library. These parameters may be compared for alternative designs to determine which option is more environmentally friendly. At present, most BIM tools provide the data to be exported to other sustainability analysis tools, but are not capable of analyzing the sustainability parameters and comparing the results for various alternative systems. In addition, most of the time the exported data need to be modified to match the input format for sustainability analysis tools. It is also true that most of the sustainability analysis tools available concentrate on sustainability parameters which are useful during operation of building, for example day lighting and energy consumption. This work is an effort to explore the power of building information modeling tools to compare the environmental parameter attributed to materials, initial embodied energy in this case, to support the decision-making process for selection of environmentally friendly design. This work also demonstrates the flexibility of BIM to modify a model and parameters associated with its elements.},

However, energy performance assessment tools have a fundamental problem concerning data interoperability among them owing to the lack of a standardized data format and access method. To address such issues, an Industry Foundation Classes (IFC)-based Input Data File (IDF) converter was developed in this research to use as a middleware to minimize the loss of information and generate additional information during the performance analysis process.

These documents undergo continuous verification and updating procedures both immediately after construction during the initial handover process to reflect construction changes and during occupancy stage for the changes that occur throughout the building's lifespan. Current as-built verification and updating procedures involve largely time consuming on-site surveys, where measurements are taken and recorded manually. In an attempt to streamline this process, the paper investigates the advantages and limitations of using photogrammetric image processing to document and verify actual as-built conditions. A test bed of both the interior and exterior of a university building is used to compare the dimensions generated by automated image processing to dimensions gathered through the manual survey process currently employed by facilities management and strategies for improved accuracy are investigated. Both manual and image-based dimensions are then used to verify dimensions of an existing as-built Building Information Model (BIM).

Climate Change Conference in Durban, South Africa, high-ranking representatives from around the world met again to discuss solutions. For the building sector, numerous energy-efficiency market changes and benchmarking resolutions, like the mandatory E.U. "nearly Net-Zero-Energy-Building (NET-ZEB's) 2018 and 2020 regulations" for all new public and privately owned buildings are now set up to help minimizing carbon emissions and reverse the negative impact.1 In the United States, the American Institute of Architects (AIA) adopted the 2030 Challenge as a voluntary program, where participating buildings aim to achieve a 90{\%} fossil fuel reduction by 2025, and carbon-neutrality by 2030.2 To accomplish these energy goals, designers must strive to best design and utilize the resources available on a site. However, are these goals of achieving carbon-neutral buildings possible? How can NET-ZEB's become the curricular standard and practical routine in education and the profession? To date, the basic curricular design process components with integrated project delivery metrics for a robust 3-D/4-D-net-zero regulatory design framework are either incomplete or missing, However, formally-based curriculums have begun to weave carbon-neutral design tools into their pedagogy. This research paper critically compares how these new criteria for digital 3-D-building information modeling (BIM), and "Integrated Project Delivery" are mandating a better integration of collaborative carbon-neutral designs into the curriculum and practice of the profession. The majority of those in architectural academia have been using generative computation primarily for pure, aesthetic form-finding, without applying zero-carbon-energy-driven global performance metrics and CO2e reduction strategies to reiterate derived carbon-neutral designs. Te advantage of 3-D-parametric design is that it links variables, dimensions, and materials to geometry in a way that when an input or simulation value changes, the 3-D/4-D model automatically updates all life-cycle scenarios and components simultaneously.},

Energy consumption data, building information, and other operations data were collected from 45 Taiwanese international tourist hotels, 19 standard tourist hotels, 116 hotel enterprises, and 20 bed and breakfast facilities. The energy use intensity (EUI) of the 4 rated hotels is 280.1, 237.7, 186.3, and 143.6 kWh/m2/year. Mean energy consumption per guest room at the 4 rated hotels is 26.7, 25.0, 14.6, and 9.4 MWh/room/year. Electricity predominantly comprises total energy consumption, which accounts for 84{\%} of total energy on average. Pearson correlations between EUI and possible explanatory indicators revealed that certain building conditions, operations, and other factors are significant. Two regression models were established to predict annual energy consumption and EUI, and gross floor area, number of guest rooms, occupancy rate, and building construction year were selected as independent variables. The coefficient of the adjusted R2 is 0.928 and 0.612, which implies reliability.

abstract = {"Architecture is a tool," once wrote the media theorist Vil{\'{e}}m Flusser when addressing the first Intl. Symposium on 'Intelligent Buildings' in 1987". [1] "Tools change our thoughts, feelings, and desires." [2] Flusser's thesis is: "we are governed by our tools even though we design them ourselves." [2] We can look at the history of mankind as a feedback process between tools and human beings. That is, ". . . exactly what we are doing when we divide history into earlier and a later stone age, a copper and bronze age, and an iron age." [2] Today, scientists create computational tools to solve society's problem of diminishing resources and climate change. The architectural profession appears to be in the throws of a massive technological transformation. However, the profession's transformation efforts utilize poor sustainability practices in architecture, which has slowed education in carbon-neutral-building and resourceuse- benchmarking with parametric-design-software tools. This begs the question of whether architectural curricula and professional initiatives are effective. The current profession's inability to reach the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (UNIPCC) goal of reducing average CO2e to 80 percent (approximately 1.3 metric tons per person per capita world-wide) by 2050 is alarming. Carbon-neutral-design and resource-use-benchmarking for a greener tomorrow on a comparable global level remains widely unaddressed, despite the increasing, world-wide planning support and exchange with interoperable, parametric BIM megadata modeling tools. The situation calls for a rapid and fundamental reorientation of our professional practice of and the education in the process of designing, constructing, and operating buildings. This paper is a critical examination of how parametric 3D/4D modeling with integrated sensor-technology can assist us in producing detailed 'what if' resource-usage and lifecycle scenarios, which enhance the design, manufacturing, operation, monitoring, and benchmarking of zero-fossil-energy buildings towards carbon neutrality. {\textcopyright} Common Ground, Thomas Spiegelhalter, All Rights Reserved.},

The complexity of those projects prevents them from being approached in a linear or hierarchical fashion, as every parameter has to be balanced in order to reach an optimum result. This paper summarizes our approach to the management of four complexities in three different projects through the use of constraints and specific processes built around the development of customized design tools. These tools focus in the interoperability and compatibility of information across the different disciplines engaged in the definition and construction of the project, paying special attention to geometric, structural and energetic issues.

abstract = {The role of the structural engineer in contributing to sustainable building seems to have been diminished to that of simply being a specifier of construction materials rather than a designer of sustainable structures. As far as the role of the structural engineer in sustainable design, it is instructive to start with buildings and the environmental burdens they carry. The buildings structural engineers are involved in designing have a major impact in the areas of water consumption, waste generation, energy use, and environmental emissions. Structural engineers should establish direct lines of communication among the structural steel team. Smaller design questions, however, would be able to be answered in a matter of hours versus days. They must ensure early involvement of the erector and fabricator in the steel design process. They should use appropriate technology solutions such as building information modeling (BIM) that can greatly enhance the sustainability of a project. A structural engineer simply needs to be a structural engineer considering every aspect of a structure's design.},

abstract = {Nanoparticles are the materials having dimensions of the order of 100 nm or less. They exhibit a high surface/volume ratio leading to different properties far different from those of the bulk materials. The development of uniform nanoparticles has been intensively pursued because of their technological and fundamental scientific importance. A number of chemical methods are available and are extensively used, but these are often energy intensive and employ toxic chemicals. An alternative approach for the synthesis of uniform nanoparticles is the biological route that occurs at ambient temperature, pressure and at neutral pH. The main aim of this review is to enlist and compare various methods of synthesis of iron-based nanoparticles with emphasis on the biological method. Biologically induced and controlled mineralization mechanisms are the two modes through which the micro-organisms synthesize iron oxide nanoparticles. In biologically induced mineralization (BIM) mode, the environmental factors like pH, pO2, pCO2, redox potential, temperature etc govern the synthesis of iron oxide nanoparticles. In contrast, biologically controlled mineralization (BCM) process initiates the micro-organism itself to control the synthesis. BIM can be observed in the Fe(III) reducing bacterial species of Shewanella, Geobacter, Thermoanaerobacter, and sulphate reducing bacterial species of Archaeoglobus fulgidus, Desulfuromonas acetoxidans, whereas BCM mode can be observed in the magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) like Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum, M. gryphiswaldense and sulphate-reducing magnetic bacteria (Desulfovibrio magneticus). Magnetite crystals formed by Fe(III)-reducing bacteria are epicellular, poorly crystalline, irregular in shapes, having a size range of 10-50 nm super-paramagnetic particles, with a saturation magnetization value ranging from 75-77 emu/g and are not aligned in chains. Magnetite crystals produced by MTB have uniform species-specific morphologies and sizes, which are mostly unknown from inorganic systems. The unusual characteristics of magnetosome particles have attracted a great interdisciplinary interest and inspired numerous ideas for their biotechnological applications. The nanoparticles synthesized through biological method are uniform with size ranging from 5 to 100 nm, which can potentially be used for various applications. {\textcopyright} Indian Academy of Sciences.},

abstract = {Today, there is a high level of demand for sustainable buildings. The most important decisions regarding a building's sustainable features are made during the design and preconstruction stages. Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED{\textregistered}) is the most widely adopted sustainable building rating system in the United States. For projects pursuing LEED{\textregistered} certification, designers have to conduct in-depth sustainability analyses based on a building's form, materials, context, and mechanical-electrical-plumbing (MEP) systems. Since Building Information Modeling (BIM) allows for multi-disciplinary information to be superimposed within one model, it creates an opportunity to conduct these analyses accurately and efficiently as compared to the traditional methods. In this exploratory research, a case study was conducted on Salisbury University's Perdue School of Business building to demonstrate the use of BIM for sustainable design and the LEED{\textregistered} certification process. First, a conceptual framework was developed to establish the relationship between BIM-based sustainability analyses and the LEED {\textregistered} certification process. Next, the framework was validated via this case study. The results of this study indicate that documentation supporting LEED{\textregistered} credits may be directly or indirectly prepared using the results of BIM-based sustainability analyses software. This process could streamline the LEED{\textregistered} certification process and save substantial time and resources which would otherwise be required using traditional methods. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

There is a general lack of professional information in BIM-based designs. The AECOO (architects, engineers, contractors, owners and operators) industry should therefore take the initiative to achieve a broad consensus about the specification of relevant information that should be standardized as content in the objects. Improved exchange of information in BIM-based software will support integrated design and delivery solutions. Objects/object libraries are proposed as the container for the exchange of information. Software objects (doors, windows, walls) and object libraries (selections of objects) with specified professional information (measurements, performance, energy, fire resistance, noise reduction, etc.) are called 'BIM objects'. The 'role-and life-cycle information model' (RIM/LIM) concept is suggested as a framework for development (specification) of relevant information in different roles and phases of a building's life cycle. A 'BIM object information standard' can be based on the RIM/LIM framework. Content in the BIM objects can be included as specifications in information delivery manuals and BIM guides. {\textcopyright} 2010 Earthscan.},

abstract = {The effects of change in surface energy and bulk viscoelastic properties on the autohesive tack strength of brominated isobutylene-co-p-methylstyrene (BIMS) rubber have been investigated by the addition of hydrocarbon resin (HCR) tackifier and maleated hydrocarbon resin (MA-g-HCR) tackifier. The addition of compatible HCR tackifier results in a reasonable increment in the tack strength of BIMS rubber by modifying only the bulk viscoelastic properties (compliance, entanglement molecular weight, relaxation time, self-diffusion, and monomer friction coefficient values) of BIMS rubber to perform better during the course of bonding and debonding steps of the peel test. Incorporation of MA-g-HCR tackifier (containing 5-20 wt {\%} of grafted maleic anhydride) steadily increases the tack strength of BIMS rubber further by precisely modifying both the surface energy and bulk viscoelastic properties to perform much better in the bonding and debonding steps. How ever, beyond 20 wt {\%} of grafted maleic anhydride in the HCR tackifier, the tack strength starts decreasing due to the incompatibility between the blend components, and hence, the bulk viscoelastic properties required for bond formation are severely retarded by the interrelated reinforcing effect and the phase separation effect of the brittle MA-g-HCR tackifier in the BIMS rubber. Hence, the polar groups in a tackifier will contribute to significant enhancement of autohesive tack strength only if the bulk viscoelastic property of the rubber-tackifier blend is favorable for bond formation and bond separation. {\textcopyright} 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Design process modeling and use of visualization tools can facilitate better communication and collaboration between team members; hence better integration in the design process. This paper presents a case study of the integrated design process of an Early Childhood Learning Center as performed by a team of university students and faculty. A process modeling approach of key decisions, required consultants, and virtual prototypes of the building was used during the design development stages of the case study. This case illustrates the use of process modeling and visualization tools to provide an accurate building information system for integrated teams. Through this experience, process modeling and visualization tools were found to be useful mechanisms to achieve high performance design goals and minimize design process waste. {\textcopyright} 2010 ASCE.},

abstract = {A recent survey by the American Institute of Architects (AIA), Washington, D C has revealed that the electrical industry is still experiencing barriers with building information modeling (BIM) technology despite an increase in the software adoption. The use of BIM requires more than the adoption of its technology by one group in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. The way the BIM software uses the memory on the machines is partly to blame for the slowdown in design. BIM is less flexible and more susceptible to user-generated problems. A positive evolution for BIM software regarding electrical components is the addition of energy modeling capabilities. The variety of BIM software applications may add costs and also cause interoperability issues. The US General Services Administration (GSA), considered the nation's largest real estate owner/operator and responsible for {\$}10 billion annually in new and renovation construction activity, has encouraged the use of building information modeling (BIM) since 2003.},

Here we report that BH3 peptides corresponding to the death domain of BH3-only proteins, which bind all the pro-survival BCL-2 family proteins, induce cell death in the absence of BAX and BAK. The BH3 peptides did not cause the release of cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria or from mitochondria in cells. However, the BH3 peptides did cause a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential but did not induce the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. Interestingly, the BH3 peptides induced mitochondria to undergo fission in the absence of BAX and BAK. The binding of BCL-XL with dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), a GTPase known to regulate mitochondrial fission, increased in the presence of BH3 peptides.

@article{Esteve-Puig2009,
abstract = {Background: Understanding the biochemical mechanisms contributing to melanoma development and progression is critical for therapeutical intervention. LKB1 is a multi-task Ser/Thr kinase that phosphorylates AMPK controlling cell growth and apoptosis under metabolic stress conditions. Additionally, LKB1Ser428 becomes phosphorylated in a RAS-Erk1/2-p90RSK pathway dependent manner. However, the connection between the RAS pathway and LKB1 is mostly unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using the UV induced HGF transgenic mouse melanoma model to investigate the interplay among HGF signaling, RAS pathway and PI3K pathway in melanoma, we identified LKB1 as a protein directly modified by HGF induced signaling. A variety of molecular techniques and tissue culture revealed that LKB1Ser428 (Ser431 in the mouse) is constitutively phosphorylated in BRAFV600E mutant melanoma cell lines and spontaneous mouse tumors with high RAS pathway activity. Interestingly, BRAFV600E mutant melanoma cells showed a very limited response to metabolic stress mediated by the LKB1-AMPK-mTOR pathway. Here we show for the first time that RAS pathway activation including BRAFV600E mutation promotes the uncoupling of AMPK from LKB1 by a mechanism that appears to be independent of LKB1Ser428 phosphorylation. Notably, the inhibition of the RAS pathway in BRAFV600E mutant melanoma cells recovered the complex formation and rescued the LKB1-AMPK$\alpha$ metabolic stress-induced response, increasing apoptosis in cooperation with the pro-apoptotic proteins Bad and Bim, and the down-regulation of Mcl-1. Conclusions/Significance: These data demonstrate that growth factor treatment and in particular oncogenic BRAFV600E induces the uncoupling of LKB1-AMPK$\alpha$ complexes providing at the same time a possible mechanism in cell proliferation that engages cell growth and cell division in response to mitogenic stimuli and resistance to low energy conditions in tumor cells. Importantly, this mechanism reveals a new level for therapeutical intervention particularly relevant in tumoras harboring a deregulated RAS-Erk1/2 pathway. {\textcopyright} 2009 Esteve-Puig et al.},

abstract = {Progressive defect generation has been a serious issue in wafer lithography, as illumination wavelength becomes shorter with the introduction of the 248 and 193 nm wavelengths. Several research groups have reported that cleaning residues, mostly ammonium and sulfate ions, on a mask surface are critical sources of progressive defect generation. A new cleaning process has been developed and studied to minimize progressive defect generation sources. The new cleaning process consists of dehydration baking, dry etching, and H 2O2 treatment. Dehydration baking was proposed to reduce the concentration of sulfate residues while H2O2 treatment and dry etching are proposed to control ammonium ions. Dehydration baking Is employed at 230°C for 600 s to reduce the sulfate ion concentrations from 32 to 1.6ppb on chrome on glass (COG) or binary intensity mask (BIM). ArF embedded attenuate phase shift mask (EAPSM) Is associated with a high concentration of ammonium ions ({\textgreater}5000ppb), and is easily susceptible to progressive defect generation under ArF illumination. More than 90{\%} ammonium extraction (removal) efficiency was achieved by H2O2 treatment for ArF EAPSM. Moreover, the optimized new cleaning process has reduced the concentration of ammonium ions up to 50ppb compared with the 1500ppb reported by conventional RCA cleaning in ArF EAPSM. In a strictly controlled sulfate environment (less than 6 ppb), threshold defect energy has improved from 25 to 100 kJ by reducing the concentration of ammonium ions down to 45 ppb and below. Therefore, the concentration of residual ammonium ions along with residual sulfate ions should be strictly controlled to improve wafer and photomask yields. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.},

With the rising cost of energy and growing environmental concerns, the demand for sustainable buildings with minimal environmental impact is increasing. The most effective decisions related to the sustainable design of a building can be made in the early design and preconstruction stages. In this context, Building Information Modeling (BIM) can aid in performing complex building performance analyses to ensure an optimized sustainable building design. This research project investigated the viability of BIM-based sustainability analyses. The objectives were: 1) determination of current state and benefits of BIM-based sustainability analyses; 2) evaluation of various building performance analyses softwares; and 3) development of a conceptual framework to illustrate the use of BIM for sustainability analyses throughout the project life-cycle. Necessary data were collected via a questionnaire survey, a case study and semi-structured interviews.

abstract = {An experimental project, called commercial building returning was undertaken in Washington, US, to identify and correct building operational problems that led to energy waste. The process was implemented through building automation systems (BASs) as significantly lower costs in comparison to the labor were required to perform it. Small and cost-effective repairs, such as replacment faulty sensors were included in the process. The focus of the project was to identify and achieve significant energy savings cost effectively. The returning process consisted of a number of primary steps that included collection of basic building information, trend-data collection and analysis, building walk down, and identification and implementation of returning actions. A monitoring plan was also developed before implementing trend logs and it focused on the factors that needed to be monitored to implement the returning process.},

The theory is that all building data would be maintained in a single data format that allows all applications to share data with all other applications. This includes intradiscipline and interdiscipline data sharing. One example of interdiscipline data sharing is the ability to exchange data directly between the architect's physical model and the engineer's load/energy model. Another multidisciplinary application is automated interference checking (sometimes referred to as clash detection). Many readers may believe these types of applications are already in use. In reality, significant technical and process limitations exist, which are preventing full implementation of these and other BIM applications.},

The overall activation energy, E,, was 6.9 kcal/mol for the Im system and 7.3 kcal/mol for the 2MIm system. The relation between log R, and 1/T was not linear for the BIm system. The polymers obtained were soluble in acetone, chloroform, benzene, and THF. The melting points of the polymers were in the range of 258-280{\textordmasculine}C.

abstract = {The role of phenolic resin tackifier on autohesive tack of brominated isobutylene-co-p-methylstyrene (BIMS) rubber was studied by a 180° peel test with particular reference to aging. Phenolic resin showed very little effect on the unaged tack of BIMS rubber. The tack strength of the rubber/resin mixture marginally increased at 1 phr resin concentration, beyond which it decreased. Based on the data on the compression creep, maximum tensile stress, and viscoelastic properties of the rubber/resin mixtures, phenolic resin did not enhance the interfacial viscous flow behavior of the rubber/resin mixtures. The results from dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed the existence of a phase-separated morphology in the rubber/resin blends even at low resin concentration. Upon aging at 100°C for 36 h, the rubber/resin blend containing 1 phr of phenolic resin showed further increase in tack strength which was attributed to migration of the tackifier to the rubber surface and the changes in the compression creep, viscoelastic behavior, and maximum tensile stress of the rubber/resin mixtures. This is also a function of aging time. Surface energy analysis by contact angle measurement, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR/ATR) studies, and surface roughness measurement by atomic force microscopy (AFM) elucidate the enrichment of the phenolic resin on the rubber surface upon aging and the mechanism of enhanced tack strength.},

Corrosion measurements based on polarization resistance (Rp), potentiodynamic polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) indicate that Diacetyl Fc, in most cases, accelerates mild steel corrosion in HCl while Diformyl Fc and BIM Fc act as weak inhibitors. In H2SO4 solution, ferrocene derivatives show good inhibition performance. The efficiency of the inhibitors follows the order: BIM Fc {\textgreater} Diformyl Fc ≫ Diacetyl Fc. Adsorption of both Diacetyl Fc and Diformyl Fc obey Langmuir adsorption isotherm with very low value of free energy of adsorption $\Delta$G{\{}ring operator{\}} for the Diformyl Fc (physisorption) while adsorption of BIM Fc follows that of Frumkin with high negative value of $\Delta$G{\{}ring operator{\}} (chemisorption). Both Diformyl Fc and BIM Fc act as mixed-type inhibitors with predominant effect on the anodic dissolution of iron. Analysis of the polarization curves and impedance spectra indicates that charge transfer process mainly controls mild steel corrosion in H2SO4 solution without and with ferrocene compounds. The mechanism of corrosion inhibition or acceleration by ferrocene derivatives was discussed in the light of the molecular structure of the additives. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

When choosing which simulation tool to use in a project, the user must consider the tool's accuracy and reliability, considering the building information they have at hand, which will serve as input for the tool. This paper presents an approach towards assessing building performance simulation results to actual measurements, using artificial neural networks (ANN) for predicting building energy performance. Training and testing of the ANN were carried out with energy consumption data acquired for 1 week in the case building called the Solar House. The predicted results show a good fitness with the mathematical model with a mean absolute error of 0.9{\%}. Moreover, four building simulation tools were selected in this study in order to compare their results with the ANN predicted energy consumption: Energy{\_}10, Green Building Studio web tool, eQuest and EnergyPlus.

In order to interpret the relevant geometrical, topological and semantical data for any given building model, we identify a structural component graph, a graph of room faces, a room graph and a relational object graph as aids and explain algorithms to derive these relations. We start with a building model by transferring its geometrical, topological and semantical data into a volume model, decomposing the latter into a so-called connection model and then extracting all air volume bodies and hulls of the model by means of further decomposition into elementary cyclic connection components. The technique is demonstrated within the scope of building energy simulation by deriving both a dimensionally reduced object model required for setting up a thermal multizone model and a geometrical model for defining single or multiple computational fluid dynamic domains in a building together with incidence matrices correlating these models. The algorithm is basically applicable to any building energy simulation tool. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag London Limited 2006.},

Regression analyses are mainly based on large amounts of metered load data, long-term weather characteristics and some information about the buildings. Energy simulation programs require detailed information about the buildings and sociological parameters, as well as thorough representation of weather data. Intelligent computer systems require metered load data, weather parameters and building information. The advantages and disadvantages of the alternative methodologies are discussed, as well as when and where to use them. Finally, the more specific usages of the methodologies are exemplified through three specific methods: conditional demand analysis (CDA), engineering method (EM) and neural networks (NN). {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The present study involves the use of this natural gum as a multifunctional additive in natural rubber (NR) and brominated isobutylene-co-paramethyl styrene (BIMS). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis was employed to study the functional groups present in the gum. It was found that fatty acids/esters in the gum act as accelerator activator and can replacestearic acid in rubber formulations. Polyphenols in the gum act as antioxidant and the action is comparable with the commercial antioxidant 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,2-dihydroquinoline (TQ) in natural rubber. The gum improves the tack strength of the rubbers (21{\%} at 2.5 phr loading for NR and 54{\%} at 10 phr loading for BIMS). The gum imparts plasticization effect which is reflected in the reduction in k and enhancement in n values, the exponents in the power law equation, with increasing gum concentration. The activation energy of flow is also reduced with the addition of the gum. Moreover, it decreases the elastic memory of the system which causes reduction in die swell. {\textcopyright} 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

A glass transition was observed at T g ≤ 107K. It was discussed as a freezing-in phenomenon of a small number of water molecules remaining partially disordered in their positional arrangement. The possibility that some defects really remain in the hydrogen-bond network of channel water was mentioned. Two subsequent phase transitions were observed at 54.8 and 59K. These were interpreted as being of a (super-structural commensurate)-incommensurate-(normal commensurate) type in the heating direction with respect to the hydrogen-atom positions as referred to the periodicity of the hydrogen-bond network. The transition entropy was evaluated to be 0.65JK-1(H2O-mol)-1 as a total of the two, indicating that the disorder of the hydrogen atoms is present only in part of the water molecules of the channel. Based on the fact that the excess heat capacity due to the equilibrium phase transition is observed down to 35-40K, the relaxation time for the rearrangement of the hydrogen-atom positions was assumed at the longest to be 1ks at 35K. This indicates that the activation energy of the rearrangement amounts to at most 13kJmol-1 and that the transfer of Bjerrum defects is attributed to the rearrangement. {\textcopyright} 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The application of bioclimatic principles is a critical factor in reducing energy consumption and CO2 emissions of the building sector. This paper develops a regression model of energy efficiency as a function of environmental conditions, building characteristics and passive solar technologies. A sample of 77 bioclimatic buildings (including 45 houses) was collected, covering Greece, other Mediterranean areas and the rest of Europe. Average energy efficiency varied from 19.6 to 100{\%} with an average of about 68{\%}. Environmental conditions included latitude, altitude, ambient temperature, degree days and sun hours; building characteristics consisted in building area and volume. Passive solar technologies included (among others) solar water heaters, shading, natural ventilation, greenhouses and thermal storage walls. Degree days and a dummy variable indicating location in the Mediterranean area were the strongest predictors of energy efficiency while taller and leaner buildings tended to be more energy efficient. Surprisingly, many passive technologies did not appear to make a difference on energy efficiency while thermal storage walls in fact seemed to decrease energy efficiency. The model developed may be of use to architects, engineers and policy makers. Suggestions for further research include obtaining more building information, investigating the effect of passive solar technologies and gathering information on the usage of building. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {As housing and commercial property markets shift from predominantly supply-push to demand-pull in some parts of Western Europe, consumers will place greater value on information regarding a building's degree of quality and performance. However, information asymmetries in present markets indicate the supply side fails to meet the building information needs of the demand side about the quality, performance and service provided by a facility. Therefore, when property is traded, the demand side's willingness to pay for value decreases and the initial price becomes the decisive factor. The question is raised whether the quality or the performance approach might stimulate the market to provide sufficient building information to counter asymmetric information. It is argued that both concepts are moving towards one another, that they are complementary and that they can form the basis of an interchanging communication medium. A comprehensive building information system is proposed that serves as a knowledge basis from which certain building information can be extracted depending on the type of enquiry. An array of indicators and criteria is categorized to allocate/match information on buildings to the parties involved. It is argued that creating an effective information exchange between market participants leads to a 'win-win' situation for the demand and supply sides in particular and for the whole construction and property industry in general. The details of this paper are related to housing property markets.},

The strength of adhesion between these two dissimilar polymers, represented by the work of detachment, G a′ is measured by using the T-peel geometry at various test temperatures and separation speeds. Surface-sensitive infrared-visible sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy is used to characterize the surface of BIMS and ensure the existence of crosslinkable species, the p-bromom-ethylstyrene functional group, on this polymer. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS) is utilized to determine the loci of failure of the debonded surfaces and the influence of curative migration, if any, on adhesion. Although a zinc di-2-ethylhexanoate crosslinkable BIMS polymer shows interfacial crosslinking or cocure when bonded to a sulfur crosslinkable diene polymer at 140°C, interfacial cocure does not occur when the bonding temperature is raised to 180°C. On the other hand, if the sulfur crosslinking agent in the diene polymer is replaced by another crosslinking agent, a brominated phenolic resin, interfacial cocure occurs between BIMS and the diene polymer when the bonding temperature is 140, 160, or 180°C. Also, this brominated resin cocures the BIMS and diene polymer phases when these immiscible polymers are blended together in the presence of a metal compound (salt) of carboxylic acid, such as zinc di-2-ethylhexanoate. {\textcopyright} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The mixed-valent species (n=2) displays significant metal-metal electronic coupling in the ground state but exhibits localized Ru(III) and Ru(II) oxidation states, as deduced from its intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) band and redox parameters. On the basis of the resonance energy (HAB) estimated in the context of Hush's semiclassical theory, the extent of intermetallic communication was found to be larger than that recently reported for the bta-bridged analog (bta = benzotriazolate). Some differences between the IVCT features of these systems have been rationalized in terms of the degree of $\sigma$,$\pi$-basic character of the bridging ligands, according to an electron super-exchange mechanism of the "hole-transfer" type. The stabilization of the mixed-valent complexes is attributed mainly to cooperative metal-to-ligand/ligand-to-metal charge-transfer effects. The combined $\pi$-acceptor and $\sigma$,$\pi$-donor abilities of the ancillary (bpy) and bridging (bim or bta) ligands, respectively, are also responsible for the high stability of the fully oxidized (RuIII-L-RuIII) and fully reduced (Ru II-L-RuII) isovalent species.},

abstract = {The proposed elastic mesh technique (EMT) is a mesh regulation technique, which is based on the assumption that the segments of a mesh are elastic. EMT can be employed in conjunction with the boundary integral method (BIM) for the simulation of three-dimension bubble dynamics in which problems relating to severe mesh distortion as the bubble evolves are a common occurrence. With EMT, the mesh is advanced not by the material velocity, but the optimum shift velocity obtained by minimizing the total elastic energy stored in every segment of the mesh at each time step. In doing so, the prohibitively small time stepping associated with small meshes without EMT in order to maintain numerical stability is mitigated to a large extent. An important feature is that the EMT scheme accords the user the flexibility to implement a non-uniform optimum constitutive relation governing the elastic behavior of mesh segment and which can be further varied with time. Tests were performed for an underwater explosion bubble exhibiting the dynamics of strong jet development with and without EMT for comparison, and the consideration of incorporating EMT as a hybrid system serving as an alternative to the required mesh refinement which is computationally intensive. A full three-dimension simulation of explosion bubble(s) and in the presence of the free surface were further carried out to elucidate the associated flow physics. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The effect of addition of EPDM rubber on melt flow properties of unfilled BIMS was also studied. Evaluation of the processability was done by measuring the extrudate roughness (ER) of the extrudates obtained from the MPT. The viscosity of the systems decreased with the shear rate, indicating their pseudoplastic or shear thinning nature. As expected, the viscosity of BIMS increased with the addition of fillers and decreased with the addition of oil. For the neat systems, viscosity increased with the addition of EPDM, and the blends showed a positive deviation, indicating interdiffusion of the polymer chains across the phase boundaries. The activation energy of the filled systems at constant filler loading increased with increasing filler surface area (N330 {\textgreater} N550 {\textgreater} N774, each at 30 phr loading), and filler loading (50 {\textgreater} 30 {\textgreater} 10 phr, for N330) and decreased with the addition of off (2.5 {\textgreater} 5.0 {\textgreater} 7.5 phr, for system containing 30 phr of N330). The silica filled system showed a higher activation energy and ER than the carbon black-filled systems. With addition of N330 and N550 carbon blacks to BIMS, the extrudate roughness (ER) decreased, whereas it increased with the addition of N774 carbon black. With an increase in filler loading, ER initially increased and then decreased as compared to the neat system. For the filled systems, ER initially decreased up to 5 phr of oil, beyond which it increased.},

abstract = {In this paper the free surface fluid flow is induced by an obstacle on the bottom of the channel whose exact shape and location are unknown a priori. The inviscid fluid flow is assumed to be steady, incompressible and irrotational under the influence of gravity. A boundary integral technique, which is based on the combination of the boundary integral method (BIM), the variational principle technique (VPT) and the application of a minimization technique (MT) is developed. Two minimization techniques, namely the extremal pressure method (EPM) and the extremal energy method (EEM), are extensively used in identifying the unknown bottom surfaces. To illustrate these techniques the free surface profile to be applied in the inverse analysis has been generated following a direct formulation when the solid bottom boundary is monotonically decreasing, monotonically increasing, when it possesses a single hump and when it possesses a single depression. It is found that in all four cases both extremum techniques can be very accurately used to identify the shape and position of the solid obstacle.},

Through examination of the fitting formulas advanced for the energies of the one-component plasmas (OCPs), we show that the sign of the deviations for the BIM energies from the linear mixing values cannot be determined from Monte Carlo simulation data for the energies alone. Instead, the sum rule with respect to the OCP screening potential at the origin is shown to be useful in judging the sign of the deviations. By using the best values currently available for the screening potential, we find that the deviations take on negative values in accordance with the prediction by Ogata, Iyetomi, Ichimaru, and Van Horn [Phys.

abstract = {Equations of state for dense binary-ionic mixture (BIM) plasmas with charge ratios RZ4.5 are evaluated for both fluid and solid phases on the basis of internal energies calculated by the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation method. The accuracy of the results has been confirmed through a sum-rule analysis of the free energy with respect to screening potentials at zero separation in one-component plasmas. Phase diagrams for various BIMs appropriate to white-dwarf interiors are constructed, including the effects of compressibility of the relativistically degenerate electrons. Eutectic diagrams, which result in significant chemical separation upon solidification, are predicted for BIMs with RZ1.6. Free energies for dense ternary-ionic mixtures are also derived for both fluid and solid phases through comparison of the corresponding MC internal energies and by a sum-rule analysis using BIM screening potentials at zero separation. We apply the results to the process of solidification of -1612O-22Ne mixtures in the interiors of white dwarfs. We find that chemical separation does indeed occur at solidification, and we obtain the result that nearly pure Ne cores are formed in such white dwarfs, even though Ne is only a trace element in the mixture. {\textcopyright} 1993 The American Physical Society.},

Information on earth-sheltered houses covers public policy issues (building code restrictions, taxation, insurance) and residential construction costs (cost breakdowns, general factors affecting costs, and life-cycle costs). The report also deals with regulatory and insurance issues (building codes, fire protection, insurance provisions) and construction costs for large underground buildings. The report recommends that: (1) the Minnesota Energy Agency consult with the Building Code Division of the Department of Administration on HUD Minimum Property Standards to examine the possibility of modifying several building code requirements that affect earth-sheltered housing design (e.g., glazing standards, natural light provisions, escape route and exit requirements); (2) HUD Minimum Property Standards be brought into line with the major building codes on the question of optional mechanical ventilation in houses; (3) model ordinances concerning setbacks, basement house provisions, and minimum square footage provisions be drafted; (4) legal questions concerning the separation of ownership of the surface from that of subsurface space be resolved; (5) questions concerning taxation of mined space be resolved; and (6) a life cost inventory of underground residence and buildings in Minnesota be compiled. {\textcopyright} 1979.},

Environmental impacts of urban design fall into measurable categories, for example, air quality, biodiversity, solid wastes, water and wastewater, hazardous materials, and impacts of nonrenewable energy use. Such measures are incorporated into building rating systems as a way of codifying sustainability. In this chapter, to illustrate such codification, we examine water use as well as generated wastewater according to the requirements of a specific sustainable building rating system. Conventional calculations are coupled with building information modeling to illustrate the overall effects of parametrically selecting fixtures, systems and materials to control the use of potable water. We further demonstrate how this approach of combining parametric building information modeling with measures of their environmental impacts can be employed on an urban scale, thereby, guiding the design of sustainable urban spaces. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

A non-uniform ferrite layer of 8–14 $\mu$m thickness was formed on the surface of 316L(N) SS due to elemental leaching of Ni and Cr. Higher carbon activity (a C ) in sodium resulted in carburization of 316L(N) SS with a surface carbon content of 0.5 wt.{\%}. The effective carbon diffusion coefficient, D eff C was estimated to be 3.64 × 10 −19 m 2 /s. Consequent to carbon transport in 316L(N) SS, extensive sensitization was detected and the charge density, P a , values for sodium exposed, thermally aged and carburized zone were found to be 23.3, 18.5 and 4.8 C/cm 2 , respectively. 42 and 60{\%} decrease in percent total elongation ({\%}TE) and percent reduction in area ({\%}RA), respectively were observed in sodium-exposed 316L(N) SS, as compared to thermally aged specimen, due to surface carburization. Unlike 316L(N) SS, modified 9Cr-1Mo steel did not show carburization, however, it showed a decrease in the impact energy values due to the presence of Laves phase and M 23 C 6 precipitates in sodium-exposed and thermally aged specimens. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

In order to break the above-mentioned limitations, this paper presents the application of the generic eco-innovation model to develop a design alternative of a green roof that is eco-friendlier, more durable, and more cost-effective, compared with existing ones. A case study incorporating building information modeling technology and energy consumption analysis software was conducted to demonstrate the benefits of the innovative green roof proposed by the generic eco-innovation model. The case study results show that the proposed eco-innovative alternative can reduce more than 20 {\%} of energy consumption of traditional roof.

abstract = {Two main challenges are faced when classifying urban land cover from very high resolution satellite images: obtaining an optimal image segmentation and distinguishing buildings from other man-made objects. For optimal segmentation, this work proposes a hierarchical representation of an image by means of a Binary Partition Tree (BPT) and an unsupervised evaluation of image segmentations by energy minimization. For building extraction, we apply fuzzy sets to create a fuzzy landscape of shadows which in turn involves a two-step procedure. The first step is a preliminarily image classification at a fine segmentation level to generate vegetation and shadow information. The second step models the directional relationship between building and shadow objects to extract building information at the optimal segmentation level. We conducted the experiments on two datasets of Pl{\'{e}}iades images from Wuhan City, China. To demonstrate its performance, the proposed classification is compared at the optimal segmentation level with Maximum Likelihood Classification and Support Vector Machine classification. The results show that the proposed classification produced the highest overall accuracies and kappa coefficients, and the smallest over-classification and under-classification geometric errors. We conclude first that integrating BPT with energy minimization offers an effective means for image segmentation. Second, we conclude that the directional relationship between building and shadow objects represented by a fuzzy landscape is important for building extraction.},

abstract = {Building simulation is widely used for building performance prediction and assessment in the design process. For seamless connections between Building Information Model (BIM) and Building Energy Model (BEM), tremendous research efforts have been invested, especially with emphasis on data sharing and reuse out of BIM. However, what is lacking in the aforementioned approach is that enough attention has not been paid to the ‘dynamic' design process strongly influenced by multiple building stakeholders with rapidly changing design context. This study presents a new approach, so called process driven energy simulation interface where a business process model is integrated with a dynamic building energy simulation tool (EnergyPlus) in WWW environment. Through the web interface, architects and simulation experts communicate and collaborate together for making an energy simulation model. Each participant of this project is called via email, SMS for data entering, simulation modeling, sharing design context and conflicts, etc. The simulation model is saved as XML format and then converted to EnergyPlus input file. In the paper, the real implementation of the aforementioned interface was discussed in detail. It was shown that a data driven model is not good enough for simulation and performance quantification. {\textcopyright} Research India Publications},
